      "Good SUV But Engine Makes Lot Of Noises\n",
      "Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone. Overall I would like to give it 8 stars out of 10. It's an excellent SUV. I love to own an American 🚙\n",

      "It's a great car. I have a Jeep Compass 2018 is a limited manual car. It was my dream to own. Till date, I haven't faced any problem. The power, handling, luxury feel, everything you get it for 20-25 lakhs is absolutely insane. More than that it's really suited to Indian road conditions. I never felt lethargic even after driving for 600+ km per day.\n",

      "Jeep Compass is the most efficient car, elegantly designed, and most powerful car in this segment, compared to Harrier, Creta this is the most efficient and it's the best value for money. Excellent driving experience with all the necessary features required in this segment of car. If any confusion with similar cars, just go and get jeep compass blindly and buy. Its limited plus version it's the best value for money.\n",

      "Its been nearly 2 years of my Jeep Compass limited edition and I must say, it's just a completely fantastic car. The features are very good. Loved this car and its value for money. Maintenance is a bit high but the person who buys 5 seaters in this range does not feel it so.\n",
