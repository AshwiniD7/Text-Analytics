      "Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone. Overall I would like to give it 8 stars out of 10. It's an excellent SUV. I love to own an American 🚙\n",

      "Jeep Compass is an excellent SUV which scores on safety features and excellent all-round performance. Jeep Compass is an excellent highway cruiser. Jeep Compass comes with safety features such as traction control, rollover mitigation, ESP, Electronic Parking Brake, Hill Assist, Hill Descent Control as standard. Jeep compass build quality, interior design, and quality are top-notch. There are some pros and cons of Compass as follows:- PROS 1. Class-leading off-roading capabilities. 2. The diesel engine is extremely frugal and responsive. 4. Dominant seven-slat grille, the sharp proportions, and the rectangular arches have succeeded in catching the attention of many Indians. There are a lot of Compass customers in India who praise its design more than anything. 5. 6 Speed Manual Gearbox is very smooth. 6. Owing to off-road character, compass gets four driving modes in its Selec- Terrain all-wheel-drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand, and Mud- the systems adjust the engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7. The individual Suspension set up of the jeep compass further increases its off-road capability. 8. Plastic quality and materials used on the compass are extremely superb and best in class. CONS 1. Missing some features. 2. Poor rear seat comfort feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3. Too much expensive. 4. 7-speed DCT Automatic gearbox is not very smooth, quickest and lacks punch. 5. The petrol engine is noisy than other rivals such as Creta and hector. 6. The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking.\n",

It has the looks which draw passerby's attention, very fun to drive due to the amount of power and torque available on hand. The build quality is commendable (both exterior and interior), far better than cars in the same segment. The numerous small features give a good feel. It gives around 12kmpl for daily city driving which is acceptable. The after sales service is a bit on the higher side and they don't provide free pick up and drop for the same, which all manufacturers do. Also, it hurts more as there are only two service outlets in Delhi and that too at different corners. Best car in its segment though.\n",

I have started taking time for myself for adventure trip. It's not just a Product, it carries Jeep legacy. Please don't Compare Jeep with Tata/Hyundai/MG.

      "I purchased the Jeep Compass Diesel Limited Option model in 2017, I choose to purchase the Jeep for its Safety Features and so I bought the Top-End model, All was going well until Dec 2018 but one night of Dec 2018, I met with an accident. I was driving Jeep Compass with my friend at a speed of about 80 to 100 km/hr on this freeway suddenly my right side front Tyre faced a problem and the car was going to its right side at same speed I tried to control it and pulled my steering towards left side and the car struck to a divider and the impact was so strong that I, my Friend and the Car all were upside down. It slid about 150 meters. Due to Seat belt on me and my friend were safe with injuries on the chest. The main thing after the accident is that I called Jeep 24/7 Customer Care, The other problem was that due to this high impact accident and the car was upside down but the Air-Bags didn't open at all and so I was seriously hurt on my chest. I had an issue that why my Air-Bags didn't open. Although I purchased the Topmost model of the car.\n",

Poor Sales Team, no knowledge on the Car itself (lol) next is about Variants. Cheating on Money. I didn't get the Invoice for the Value that I have paid. Insurance amount has been doubled than the actual Insurance JEEP has provided upon Purchase. Poor After Sales support. Poor Customer support. Unfit JEEP Management. Useless of saying themselves as a Premium Brand. I have paid for INR75,000/- worth Mopar Maintenance Package along with my car which includes additional 2 years Roadside Assistance, 2 years of Extended Warranty and 5 years of Free Maintenance. Jeep provided only Extended Warranty and didn't provide me with the Rest 2. It's been almost 5 months, despite continuous follow-ups. Jeep is very Reluctant in the Issue and no one cares on this Issue. ISSUE MAY BE ANY BUT THERE SHOULD BE A PROPER RESPONSE FOR THE MONEY PAID and I don't understand why are they calling themselves as a premium brand. It's like, I HAVE BEEN CHEATED.\n",

      "My name is Johnson Correya and I currently reside in Powai (Mumbai). I have purchased a petrol model Jeep Compass Sports Variant with Manual Transmission. Before buying the vehicle, I had checked reviews on different websites about this vehicle and discussed the features with the sales team, especially with the salesperson from the Landmark Mumbai showroom (Abhishek). All automobile related sites and the salesman had claimed that the mileage for this model is 14-17 km/liter. I don't have any other problems with this model except the mileage for which I am getting an average of 5 to 5.5 km/liter with a mixture of conditions like traffic, without traffic and high way etc. I approached the CRM Mr. Salim who asked me to bring the car for a check-up. I dropped the vehicle off on 14/11/18 after completing 1200 km. I had reset the meter just before I dropped the vehicle at the service center. Service adviser Prateek attended my vehicle and suggested me to come back after 3 days as they wanted to test the entire vehicle. I complied and collected the vehicle after 3 days had elapsed. While I was collecting the vehicle, he informed me that they had checked the vehicle in traffic conditions and they had gotten 10 km/liter with no other technical issues in the vehicle. They have written the average mileage as 10 km/liter in the service form. I checked the mileage meter just after leaving the service center then I realized that the mileage was 4.5km/liter and they have driven the vehicle 14.5 km. It was a barefaced lie which they told me that they got 10 km/liter in traffic conditions. I had informed the mileage issue to the CRM (Salim) again. He had suggested that he would send one person with me to check my driving pattern. He had sent Aditya Dhere on 23.11.18 at 6 pm at my office. He accompanied me for 2 km in traffic conditions. He understood that the issue is with the mileage and not with my driving patterns. He had taken a picture of the mileage meter and sent it to the CRM. We got 2.2 km/liter for around 2 km drive with 25 minutes of travel. I don't travel always in traffic, 5-5.5 is an average of a mix (all conditions). It is not worth driving this vehicle with the kind of average I get and why the company is offering an impossible mileage of 14-17 km/liter is ludicrous and preposterous. They haven't given any solution till date. My humble request to the customers, please do not buy Jeep compass as they are selling the car with fake commitments.\n",

The Jeep team is not ready to accept the mileage issues. I have sent several emails to the entire Jeep team and there were no reply and solution. I am getting an average mileage of 5-6KM/L after driving 2500km with different conditions. My humble request to all customers who are planning to buy Jeep compass, please check the mileage on different conditions (traffic /non-traffic etc.) to get the real mileage. Do not believe the salesperson who just wants to sell the car.\n",

      "We are a family of four and we all are really fond of cars including my little one 2 years old as well. The elder 10 year old son can rattle the power and torque figures of different cars. Most of the cars we have owned are driving oriented and we always take the build quality, driving dynamics and safety as top priorities every time we choose a new car. Just to name the cars in our fleet in the past, we owned Ford Fiesta, Honda Civic, Skoda Yeti and Laura. All these cars gave brilliant experience with well sorted performance. But choosing the Yeti successor was quite a difficult task as the list of priorities increased all these years. We shortlisted the priorities which included nice driving dynamics, strong build quality and safety, leather steering wheel, leather seats, silent/powerful diesel engine, spaciousness, distinct styling and of course, the hill hold control since I have phobia of rolling back. So, fortunately we were able to shortlist the cars and the list included Renault Duster, Audi Q3, BMW X1, Skoda Kodiaq, VW Tiguan and Jeep Compass. The Audi and BMW were rejected due to fact that our regular drives to the outskirts where my grandparents live would prove a nightmare for these cars. Skoda Kodiaq and VW Tiguan were outrageously priced for what they offer while we listed out Renault Duster because it lacks adequate safety features. So, the last option remained in the list which was meeting all our expectations was Jeep Compass. Now coming to the initial experience, man, it's a head turner. Wherever I take my blazing red Jeep Compass, it really grabs eyeballs. It has pretty striking similarity with the Range Rover Evoque, especially the blackened roof. My wife is really smitten with this car, during the early drive of 40 kms, we drove equally for 30 kilometers. The car is exceptionally comfortable to drive with the engine barely audible from inside even if you cruise at the speed of 80kmph. The 2.0L engine produces 173PS and 350Nm of peak torque with the SUV giving above 16kmpl mileage in mix conditions which is pretty much acceptable given the stature of the car. With linear acceleration, the vehicle can reach the 80-90kmph mark in no time. The engine is quite smooth and does not have turbo lag unlike other cars we owned in the past. Coming to the part which I liked the most is the robust quality this car comes with. It is heavy especially the doors, hood and the tailgate. The car comes with all the safety aspects which we needed including dual airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill start assist, electronic parking brake and ISOFIX rear child seat mounts. The braking is adequate and it comes to halt in the straight line without any fuss. In terms of comfort inside, the car is an absolute bliss with enough legroom at the rear which most people complain about in the car. The car has all the contemporary gizmos including the 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto support and a very effective air conditioner. However, the sound output from the AV system was mediocre although one can always add extra speakers to increase the decibels. Driven over 3000kms so far and it has been a wonderful experience with this car. Anyone who wants a little show-off with utter cabin comfort, safety and smooth engine performance, I think Jeep Compass can be a good choice under Rs. 25 lakhs.\n",

      "3) Quality\n",
      "4) Attractive Look\n",
      "5) Power If you are practical to have number of features over your paying price, then this Jeep Compass is not for you. Many other brands giving you so much in 65% price of Jeep Compass. They are committed for after sales service but they may have a practical issue with on -road service or stock issue as they are rising and not completely established. But Jeep is always known for Lavish driving and safety. If you are a passionate driver then this Car is for you. I drove almost 4000 KM in a month. I had a good experience. One more thing any variant of Jeep compass does not have any mechanical change except 4X4 ,6 Airbags and Tyre Size. All is about Exterior and Interior. You will get the same pleasure in any of variant. Jeep is Jeep. I love it. I was looking for Make In India Concept and came to know Jeep has been manufactured at Ranjangaon facility in Pune. 65% material was bought from local vendor. Also they are exporting International.\n",

      "Jeep Compass as the name strikes the mind, we get the image of the hardcore off-road Jeep-like vehicle but that?s not the case with the Jeep Compass. Though it?s a plush as well as off-roader it dons the typical city SUV looks. I bought my Jeep Compass in January 2018 and till date, it never failed to impress me in one way or the other. Its amazing performance and features are quite inspiring while its exterior and interior looks make one give a second glance for sure. Jeep Compass was first introduced in July 2017 in the Indian subcontinent making it as a strong player against other compact SUVs in this space. The vehicle was designed to look like a baby Grand Cherokee and gets some of the features from Jeep Renegade. The SUV features vertically slatted wide radiator grille, muscular front bumper, and high mounted headlamps. Side profile gets the prominent shoulder line and squared wheel arches while the rear portion is neatly finished. Inside, the first thing that catches the eye is the Uconnect infotainment unit that supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay placed at the center of the dashboard. The car also gets dual-zone automatic temperature control and seats are covered with Ski grey leather upholstery. For better safety, Jeep Compass comes loaded with numerous features such as dual front airbags, traction control, ABS and EBD. I own the powerful diesel engine that is the 2.0L motor that belts out 173PS of power and mated to six-speed manual gearbox. The car possesses mature suspension setup, nicely-tuned EPS & rock-solid stability that translate to excellent drivability. So, Jeep Compass is leading the way in practical and finest design and delivers the perfect driving experience. The car is well priced for what it offers. So if you are the one who loves the attractive design under reasonable pricing along with tough build, quality cabin, and genuine driving experience, then nothing is left to ignore this piece of machine.\n",

      "I bought limited(O) diesel from Mohali dealership on 10th January 2018 and I must say my experience till now is great in all aspects.When I confirmed my purchase, I got delivery next day as one day took for banking formalities. That was amazing experience. The dealership here in Mohali is very professional and customer oriented, they even changed the car before delivery as I found one paint issue in the previous car and they provided a new car. They gave me plenty of time to check and verify the car again till I got satisfied. Till now I have driven around 3350 kms and my experience is awesome either in city or highways. As Chandigarh/Mohali doesn't have traffic like Delhi or Mumbai, I am getting mileage of around 16.5 km/l and on highways it gave me maximum of 20.5 km/l while driving at maximum speed of 100 km/hour. I love the interiors, although maintenance is high as seat covers and doors are light colored as per my model but it looks premium. The music system is great as well electronic break, it is a great feature. Also You can manage other stuff within infotainment system like controlling lights, doors, phone etc. People are saying that it doesn't have cruise control but for me it is not essential as in India, roads are not build for it. When you are on highway, any animal or people can come in between. I think sunroof could be a good option if they add in the future as well automatic in diesel. I don't mind manual transmission but automatic is helpful when there are long traffic jams. As far as car's build is concerned, It is heavy build with great quality. On highway, I had a major accident when a Harley Davidson rammed into right front grill/bumper and to my surprise, It got nothing except a small scratch which was removed by dealership later on. I must say the quality is really good. Car is a head turner for sure, I have seen how people react when you are on road, it gives a personality and car looks very rugged and manly. I have heard bad reviews about dealership and services but nothing like this happened to me. Even they gave me training to use infotainment system as well the best way to maintain the car. They are available on one phone call. I am happy with my choice. If anyone wants to ask anything, feel free to write me.\n",

      "I started following all the updates on this small SUV the moment it was announced for the Indian market. The key reason behind purchasing this car was the attractive design with which I fell in love at the first sight. And since it is a Jeep product, I wasn't caring much about the build quality and the driving experience. The ride and handling of the Jeep Compass certainly make it a true blue SUV, especially the high-speed stability and the way suspension gulps the potholes is beyond words. But honestly, this SUV is not perfect. The car is not spacious given its size. It also lacks some key features that should have been integrated by Jeep such as sunroof, auto headlights, cruise control and rain sensing wipers. So in my opinion, Jeep should address these issues asap since parent company Fiat does not have a good reputation in terms of sales and services. Although Jeep is giving 2 years/unlimited kms warranty on the car to encourage the buyers, still a lot more effort is needed from the company to turn the tables to its side.\n",

      "Good to be back again?this time I am writing a review for the Jeep Compass Longitude Diesel MT. This is the mid segment jeep in the compass series. To start with let me tell you the vehicle is absolutely ?SOLID? heavy build and gives you an impeccable presence wherever you go. So lets talk engine dynamics, the diesel engine of this baby is a 2 Ltr Multijet diesel engine meshed with a 6 speed gear box yielding 173 PS power which is sufficient to propel this vehicle really fast. The acceleration is good but the pickup still might need some work. It can be blamed on the heavy build of the vehicle as the engine after all is 2 ltr. The breaking is pretty efficient as I did try the odd ball 60 KM/HR to ?0? breaking and the vehicle responded perfectly telling me that the ABS and EBD systems gelled perfectly. Let?s talk driving comfort now, although the gear shifts are smooth but the clutch does require some pushing and in city driving you might get a bit of a foot ache if you are not used to it. The vehicle can power down if you are at a low speed trying to drive at a higher gear. One thing I really loved was the electronic parking brake which replaced a hand brake with a nifty little button where the hand brake used to exist. Now coming to the ergonomics on this vehicle, the instrument cluster is well lit and the infotainment system has just the right features. I bought the Longitude and not the optional so features like car play and android auto were not available. They did provide a usb port in the rear which was pretty good. There were a couple of things which did disappoint like there was no climatronic AC, although the door handled has leathered upholstery the seats were fabric which was very disappointing and the Jeep accessory for the seat costed about 16000 MRP. The car has reverse parking sensors but no camera which is not one would expect after paying a good amount for this car and lets face it, it doesn?t cost much. Another things which was painful was that the car?s speaker system was absolutely flat no zing to it. The car does have traction control but not sure how much of that you would use. In summary the car is excellent in terms of handling and well grounded, the features are there but for the price I paid I expected much more. Overall, if you would really like a Jeep with all the bells and whistled go for a Longitude Optional or Limited. Happy and safe driving.\n",

      "I am an Air Force Officer and was impressed by the Jeep 4X4 month offer and went to a dealer in Bangalore for enquiring about the same. I had carried my cheque book to book the vehicle in anticipation of an honest interaction with the sales personI first asked him about the CSD price list. He said that he doesn't have it. From the tone and tenour of his reply It appeared that he was giving me the concession and not the government. Then I enquired about the 4X4 month. Initially he was skirting the issue, and on my insistance and pointing out to a promo lying on the table, he confirmed there was such a scheme. I told him that I am waiting for some money as my mutual fund has matured and hence would book it ASAP. To this he said that I must book it immediately. He said that if the vehicle is delivered in May, then I will not get the offer. I replied to him that the information I have is that if I book it before 30 Apr, I will be able to avail it. He again repeated that if the deliver is in May then he cannot give me the offer. I was feeling that I was not sitting with a salesman of a reputed brand like Jeep. It was like sales at gunpoint ......\"I cant say prices will increase etc........\" It was like sitting on the edge of a cliff waiting to be pushed off The product is very good, but this is not the end. But arrogant people like this waiting to I have to go to these kind of people for service for the rest of the vehicles life. It is very difficult to do that after today's experince. When they can renege on their word today, they will do it every day. A conf call with the dealer was arranged and the person at the dealership was relatively polite now, but I was too disturbed to reconsider the issue Hence I have glad that I did not sink my money into this unwelcome pit\n",

As we drove down the highways, the car felt well planted and I didn?t have to switch gears very frequently in order to keep the car moving, which made it pretty relaxing to drive. But when we came back in the city, the heavy clutch started to get irritating and painful. The infotainment system offered with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will not disappoint you but it would have been better if it had a large screen in place. I quite liked the car and I would like to get one myself but the unavailability of an automatic transmission is a deal breaker for me. I hope Jeep gets the automatic version soon so I can get one for myself.\n",

      "As and when Compass comes with AT 4x4 it will cost atleast 23.5 and obviously as it is a new launch there are no discount offers. Tucson with discount offers between 1-1.5 L is going to be available for almost the same price as the AT 4x4 Compass. Therefore a Tucson which is bigger, more powerful, more fuel efficient, better dynamically designed, more reliable, better ASS network, better looking ( depends on ones own taste), drives more like a sedan ( most of ones driving is going to be on metalled roads), needs serious considerations.As far as brand value (snob value ) is concerned worldwide Hyundai sells more Tucson than Jeep selling compass and has better ratings.In fact Jeep products are at the bottom of the rung. Now the present compass may be a new vehicle and may behave differently but it is still untested. A short test drive is not enough to test a vehicle which is going to cost more than 25 L.\n",

Fake data they are disclosing that 5000 cars has been delivered or 10000+ booking completed but actual data is wrong, very few cars on road, almost everyone is waiting and wasting their time. Dealers initially promise that they will deliver the car in first lot itself but you won?t get even status , just next day or next week. Those who call, they get answer from dealer and jeep india customer care that they will call back but you wont get call for days and weeks for status. Total failure in communication between Jeep FCA and dealers. Dealers would say that jeep is not giving cars and jeep would ask you to contact dealers or put you in conference call with dealers who will be not ur sales person, he will says that we have not yet given april/may month booking and long story they will tell you and indirectly they pass the message, either wait or go to hell.\n",

Although the high door sills do get in the way at times, especially when you are in a hurry. The sound system is amazing but I can't say the same for the infotainment display. Yes, it has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility but there's a noticeable lag in its operation. I have bought the 2.0-litre Limited variant without the 4x4 system. Up until now, I am more than satisfied with the Compass. But as I mentioned above, there are some drawbacks. But then that's the case with all cars I believe. To finish it off, I would just like to add that if you want something different and capable at the same time, the Jeep Compass will not disappoint you.\n",

      "First 3 version of Jeep Compass are not worth the money - but things change when you look at Limited option & onwards. You get all the features one would like to see in a compact SUV - Price is bit higher compared to other brands but brand also matters so i'm sure people will go for Compass & will not look at the price.\n"

      "I have been a huge fan of Jeep badge. The sturdy and macho vehicles that this American brand manufactures are simply unmatchable. I have been following the Jeep Compass since the time it was first showcased. The massive road presence and the sharp styling of the Compass SUV cannot be compared to any other crossover in the country. Apart from this, its tyres will get your heart racing, they are just fantastic.The crossover is fully loaded but the biggest surprise came in the form of the price. Just Rs 14.95 lakh! I am amazed with Jeep's pricing strategy, it undercuts almost all its rivals and is definitely here to rule the Indian automotive arena. The other plus points of the Compass is the availability in both the petrol and diesel engines. Another important bit of the Jeep SUV is the Jeep Active Drive 4x4 system which disconnects rear axle and effortlessly keeps on switching between 4x2 and 4x4 drive types to ensure one gets the 4x4 capability only when it's essential, thus saving the extra effort of the vehicle. I am sure it must be helping out on the fuel efficiency numbers as well. With the Compass, a new beast of performance is here. I am keeping my fingers crossed and will be watching how the sales of the Compass take off. However, the more critical aspect is how Jeep is able to tackle the after-sales service of the Compass in a country obsessed with 'cheap and best' philosophy.\n",

      "I saw the Jeep Compass at a nearby dealership today. It is smaller than what it looks in the images. The Tucson, in comparison, looks wider. Sit inside and the quality of the materials used is good. The space is also decent and two six-feet tall guys can sit one behind the other. But it doesn't look as wide as you think it will be. From the driver's seat, it feels as if you're sitting in a vehicle of Creta's size. After sitting in the Compressed, sorry Compass, I felt that the starting price of around Rs 15 lakh is fair, and not very aggressive. Also, considering the reliability issues with the brand in most other markets, even if you are saving some money upfront, it'll be used up on the SUV only, and may not count as savings. There were a lot of people out there to check the Compass in the dealership and it looks like it will sell in good numbers. But I think I'll wait to see how Jeep fares in the after-sales department. I'm not sure if they'll be able to manage it.\n",

       "  'Review': \"Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone. Overall I would like to give it 8 stars out of 10. It's an excellent SUV. I love to own an American 🚙\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'Jeep Compass is an excellent SUV which scores on safety features and excellent all-round performance. Jeep Compass is an excellent highway cruiser. Jeep Compass comes with safety features such as traction control, rollover mitigation, ESP, Electronic Parking Brake, Hill Assist, Hill Descent Control as standard. Jeep compass build quality, interior design, and quality are top-notch. There are some pros and cons of Compass as follows:- PROS 1. Class-leading off-roading capabilities. 2. The diesel engine is extremely frugal and responsive. 4. Dominant seven-slat grille, the sharp proportions, and the rectangular arches have succeeded in catching the attention of many Indians. There are a lot of Compass customers in India who praise its design more than anything. 5. 6 Speed Manual Gearbox is very smooth. 6. Owing to off-road character, compass gets four driving modes in its Selec- Terrain all-wheel-drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand, and Mud- the systems adjust the engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7. The individual Suspension set up of the jeep compass further increases its off-road capability. 8. Plastic quality and materials used on the compass are extremely superb and best in class. CONS 1. Missing some features. 2. Poor rear seat comfort feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3. Too much expensive. 4. 7-speed DCT Automatic gearbox is not very smooth, quickest and lacks punch. 5. The petrol engine is noisy than other rivals such as Creta and hector. 6. The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking.',\n",

It has the looks which draw passerby's attention, very fun to drive due to the amount of power and torque available on hand. The build quality is commendable (both exterior and interior), far better than cars in the same segment. The numerous small features give a good feel. It gives around 12kmpl for daily city driving which is acceptable. The after sales service is a bit on the higher side and they don't provide free pick up and drop for the same, which all manufacturers do. Also, it hurts more as there are only two service outlets in Delhi and that too at different corners. Best car in its segment though.\",\n",

Top speed at 205kmph, the torque and speed are enormous after second gear. A very stable vehicle at high speeds and McPherson strut shock absorbers just smoothens the ride at all terrain. If you looking up for a long drive this vehicle is just meant for you. I have driven this vehicle for 25,000kms in 6 months and never has there been an issue.

Now, as it is a Jeep, so I do take it for weekend trails, where its off road capability is really amazing. I Own the limited Plus 4×4 variant which has everything what i would expect when even I am Considering X1 X line/Xc40/Q3 with quarto technology. I have started taking time for myself for adventure trip. It's not just a Product, it carries Jeep legacy. Please don't Compare Jeep with Tata/Hyundai/MG. MG is coming up with lots of features as showing in internet...but certainly MG as a brand has no history of off road Capability, also when it Comes to tough terrains Cosmetics Doesn't take out further. Believe in Legends & drive one. Jeep stands above all.\",\n",

I was driving Jeep Compass with my friend at a speed of about 80 to 100 km/hr on this freeway suddenly my right side front Tyre faced a problem and the car was going to its right side at same speed I tried to control it and pulled my steering towards left side and the car struck to a divider and the impact was so strong that I, my Friend and the Car all were upside down. It slid about 150 meters. Due to Seat belt on me and my friend were safe with injuries on the chest. The main thing after the accident is that I called Jeep 24/7 Customer Care, The other problem was that due to this high impact accident and the car was upside down but the Air-Bags didn't open at all and so I was seriously hurt on my chest. I had an issue that why my Air-Bags didn't open. Although I purchased the Topmost model of the car.\",\n",

Poor Sales Team, no knowledge on the Car itself (lol) next is about Variants. Cheating on Money. I didn't get the Invoice for the Value that I have paid. Insurance amount has been doubled than the actual Insurance JEEP has provided upon Purchase. Poor After Sales support. Poor Customer support. Unfit JEEP Management. Useless of saying themselves as a Premium Brand. I have paid for INR75,000/- worth Mopar Maintenance Package along with my car which includes additional 2 years Roadside Assistance, 2 years of Extended Warranty and 5 years of Free Maintenance. Jeep provided only Extended Warranty and didn't provide me with the Rest 2. It's been almost 5 months, despite continuous follow-ups. Jeep is very Reluctant in the Issue and no one cares on this Issue. ISSUE MAY BE ANY BUT THERE SHOULD BE A PROPER RESPONSE FOR THE MONEY PAID and I don't understand why are they calling themselves as a premium brand. It's like, I HAVE BEEN CHEATED.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"My name is Johnson Correya and I currently reside in Powai (Mumbai). I have purchased a petrol model Jeep Compass Sports Variant with Manual Transmission. Before buying the vehicle, I had checked reviews on different websites about this vehicle and discussed the features with the sales team, especially with the salesperson from the Landmark Mumbai showroom (Abhishek). All automobile related sites and the salesman had claimed that the mileage for this model is 14-17 km/liter. I don't have any other problems with this model except the mileage for which I am getting an average of 5 to 5.5 km/liter with a mixture of conditions like traffic, without traffic and high way etc. I approached the CRM Mr. Salim who asked me to bring the car for a check-up. I dropped the vehicle off on 14/11/18 after completing 1200 km. I had reset the meter just before I dropped the vehicle at the service center. Service adviser Prateek attended my vehicle and suggested me to come back after 3 days as they wanted to test the entire vehicle. I complied and collected the vehicle after 3 days had elapsed. While I was collecting the vehicle, he informed me that they had checked the vehicle in traffic conditions and they had gotten 10 km/liter with no other technical issues in the vehicle. They have written the average mileage as 10 km/liter in the service form. I checked the mileage meter just after leaving the service center then I realized that the mileage was 4.5km/liter and they have driven the vehicle 14.5 km. It was a barefaced lie which they told me that they got 10 km/liter in traffic conditions. I had informed the mileage issue to the CRM (Salim) again. He had suggested that he would send one person with me to check my driving pattern. He had sent Aditya Dhere on 23.11.18 at 6 pm at my office. He accompanied me for 2 km in traffic conditions. He understood that the issue is with the mileage and not with my driving patterns. He had taken a picture of the mileage meter and sent it to the CRM. We got 2.2 km/liter for around 2 km drive with 25 minutes of travel. I don't travel always in traffic, 5-5.5 is an average of a mix (all conditions). It is not worth driving this vehicle with the kind of average I get and why the company is offering an impossible mileage of 14-17 km/liter is ludicrous and preposterous. They haven't given any solution till date. My humble request to the customers, please do not buy Jeep compass as they are selling the car with fake commitments.\",\n",

The Jeep team is not ready to accept the mileage issues. I have sent several emails to the entire Jeep team and there were no reply and solution. I am getting an average mileage of 5-6KM/L after driving 2500km with different conditions. My humble request to all customers who are planning to buy Jeep compass, please check the mileage on different conditions (traffic /non-traffic etc.) to get the real mileage.

       "  'Review': \"We are a family of four and we all are really fond of cars including my little one 2 years old as well. The elder 10 year old son can rattle the power and torque figures of different cars. Most of the cars we have owned are driving oriented and we always take the build quality, driving dynamics and safety as top priorities every time we choose a new car. Just to name the cars in our fleet in the past, we owned Ford Fiesta, Honda Civic, Skoda Yeti and Laura. All these cars gave brilliant experience with well sorted performance. But choosing the Yeti successor was quite a difficult task as the list of priorities increased all these years. We shortlisted the priorities which included nice driving dynamics, strong build quality and safety, leather steering wheel, leather seats, silent/powerful diesel engine, spaciousness, distinct styling and of course, the hill hold control since I have phobia of rolling back. So, fortunately we were able to shortlist the cars and the list included Renault Duster, Audi Q3, BMW X1, Skoda Kodiaq, VW Tiguan and Jeep Compass. The Audi and BMW were rejected due to fact that our regular drives to the outskirts where my grandparents live would prove a nightmare for these cars. Skoda Kodiaq and VW Tiguan were outrageously priced for what they offer while we listed out Renault Duster because it lacks adequate safety features. So, the last option remained in the list which was meeting all our expectations was Jeep Compass. Now coming to the initial experience, man, it's a head turner. Wherever I take my blazing red Jeep Compass, it really grabs eyeballs. It has pretty striking similarity with the Range Rover Evoque, especially the blackened roof. My wife is really smitten with this car, during the early drive of 40 kms, we drove equally for 30 kilometers. The car is exceptionally comfortable to drive with the engine barely audible from inside even if you cruise at the speed of 80kmph. The 2.0L engine produces 173PS and 350Nm of peak torque with the SUV giving above 16kmpl mileage in mix conditions which is pretty much acceptable given the stature of the car. With linear acceleration, the vehicle can reach the 80-90kmph mark in no time. The engine is quite smooth and does not have turbo lag unlike other cars we owned in the past. Coming to the part which I liked the most is the robust quality this car comes with. It is heavy especially the doors, hood and the tailgate. The car comes with all the safety aspects which we needed including dual airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill start assist, electronic parking brake and ISOFIX rear child seat mounts. The braking is adequate and it comes to halt in the straight line without any fuss. In terms of comfort inside, the car is an absolute bliss with enough legroom at the rear which most people complain about in the car. The car has all the contemporary gizmos including the 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto support and a very effective air conditioner. However, the sound output from the AV system was mediocre although one can always add extra speakers to increase the decibels. Driven over 3000kms so far and it has been a wonderful experience with this car. Anyone who wants a little show-off with utter cabin comfort, safety and smooth engine performance, I think Jeep Compass can be a good choice under Rs. 25 lakhs.\",\n",

Followings were in my mind while choosing Car.\\n1) Safety\\n2) Comfort\\n3) Quality\\n4) Attractive Look\\n5) Power If you are practical to have number of features over your paying price, then this Jeep Compass is not for you. Many other brands giving you so much in 65% price of Jeep Compass. They are committed for after sales service but they may have a practical issue with on -road service or stock issue as they are rising and not completely established. But Jeep is always known for Lavish driving and safety. If you are a passionate driver then this Car is for you. I drove almost 4000 KM in a month. I had a good experience. One more thing any variant of Jeep compass does not have any mechanical change except 4X4 ,6 Airbags and Tyre Size. All is about Exterior and Interior. You will get the same pleasure in any of variant. Jeep is Jeep. I love it. I was looking for Make In India Concept and came to know Jeep has been manufactured at Ranjangaon facility in Pune. 65% material was bought from local vendor. Also they are exporting International.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'Jeep Compass as the name strikes the mind, we get the image of the hardcore off-road Jeep-like vehicle but that?s not the case with the Jeep Compass. Though it?s a plush as well as off-roader it dons the typical city SUV looks. I bought my Jeep Compass in January 2018 and till date, it never failed to impress me in one way or the other. Its amazing performance and features are quite inspiring while its exterior and interior looks make one give a second glance for sure. Jeep Compass was first introduced in July 2017 in the Indian subcontinent making it as a strong player against other compact SUVs in this space. The vehicle was designed to look like a baby Grand Cherokee and gets some of the features from Jeep Renegade. The SUV features vertically slatted wide radiator grille, muscular front bumper, and high mounted headlamps. Side profile gets the prominent shoulder line and squared wheel arches while the rear portion is neatly finished. Inside, the first thing that catches the eye is the Uconnect infotainment unit that supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay placed at the center of the dashboard. The car also gets dual-zone automatic temperature control and seats are covered with Ski grey leather upholstery. For better safety, Jeep Compass comes loaded with numerous features such as dual front airbags, traction control, ABS and EBD. I own the powerful diesel engine that is the 2.0L motor that belts out 173PS of power and mated to six-speed manual gearbox. The car possesses mature suspension setup, nicely-tuned EPS & rock-solid stability that translate to excellent drivability. So, Jeep Compass is leading the way in practical and finest design and delivers the perfect driving experience. The car is well priced for what it offers. So if you are the one who loves the attractive design under reasonable pricing along with tough build, quality cabin, and genuine driving experience, then nothing is left to ignore this piece of machine.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"I bought limited(O) diesel from Mohali dealership on 10th January 2018 and I must say my experience till now is great in all aspects.When I confirmed my purchase, I got delivery next day as one day took for banking formalities. That was amazing experience. The dealership here in Mohali is very professional and customer oriented, they even changed the car before delivery as I found one paint issue in the previous car and they provided a new car. They gave me plenty of time to check and verify the car again till I got satisfied. Till now I have driven around 3350 kms and my experience is awesome either in city or highways. As Chandigarh/Mohali doesn't have traffic like Delhi or Mumbai, I am getting mileage of around 16.5 km/l and on highways it gave me maximum of 20.5 km/l while driving at maximum speed of 100 km/hour. I love the interiors, although maintenance is high as seat covers and doors are light colored as per my model but it looks premium. The music system is great as well electronic break, it is a great feature. Also You can manage other stuff within infotainment system like controlling lights, doors, phone etc. People are saying that it doesn't have cruise control but for me it is not essential as in India, roads are not build for it. When you are on highway, any animal or people can come in between. I think sunroof could be a good option if they add in the future as well automatic in diesel. I don't mind manual transmission but automatic is helpful when there are long traffic jams. As far as car's build is concerned, It is heavy build with great quality. On highway, I had a major accident when a Harley Davidson rammed into right front grill/bumper and to my surprise, It got nothing except a small scratch which was removed by dealership later on. I must say the quality is really good. Car is a head turner for sure, I have seen how people react when you are on road, it gives a personality and car looks very rugged and manly. I have heard bad reviews about dealership and services but nothing like this happened to me. Even they gave me training to use infotainment system as well the best way to maintain the car. They are available on one phone call. I am happy with my choice. If anyone wants to ask anything, feel free to write me.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"I started following all the updates on this small SUV the moment it was announced for the Indian market. The key reason behind purchasing this car was the attractive design with which I fell in love at the first sight. And since it is a Jeep product, I wasn't caring much about the build quality and the driving experience. The ride and handling of the Jeep Compass certainly make it a true blue SUV, especially the high-speed stability and the way suspension gulps the potholes is beyond words. But honestly, this SUV is not perfect. The car is not spacious given its size. It also lacks some key features that should have been integrated by Jeep such as sunroof, auto headlights, cruise control and rain sensing wipers. So in my opinion, Jeep should address these issues asap since parent company Fiat does not have a good reputation in terms of sales and services. Although Jeep is giving 2 years/unlimited kms warranty on the car to encourage the buyers, still a lot more effort is needed from the company to turn the tables to its side.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'Good to be back again?this time I am writing a review for the Jeep Compass Longitude Diesel MT. This is the mid segment jeep in the compass series. To start with let me tell you the vehicle is absolutely ?SOLID? heavy build and gives you an impeccable presence wherever you go. So lets talk engine dynamics, the diesel engine of this baby is a 2 Ltr Multijet diesel engine meshed with a 6 speed gear box yielding 173 PS power which is sufficient to propel this vehicle really fast. The acceleration is good but the pickup still might need some work. It can be blamed on the heavy build of the vehicle as the engine after all is 2 ltr. The breaking is pretty efficient as I did try the odd ball 60 KM/HR to ?0? breaking and the vehicle responded perfectly telling me that the ABS and EBD systems gelled perfectly. Let?s talk driving comfort now, although the gear shifts are smooth but the clutch does require some pushing and in city driving you might get a bit of a foot ache if you are not used to it. The vehicle can power down if you are at a low speed trying to drive at a higher gear. One thing I really loved was the electronic parking brake which replaced a hand brake with a nifty little button where the hand brake used to exist. Now coming to the ergonomics on this vehicle, the instrument cluster is well lit and the infotainment system has just the right features. I bought the Longitude and not the optional so features like car play and android auto were not available. They did provide a usb port in the rear which was pretty good. There were a couple of things which did disappoint like there was no climatronic AC, although the door handled has leathered upholstery the seats were fabric which was very disappointing and the Jeep accessory for the seat costed about 16000 MRP. The car has reverse parking sensors but no camera which is not one would expect after paying a good amount for this car and lets face it, it doesn?t cost much. Another things which was painful was that the car?s speaker system was absolutely flat no zing to it. The car does have traction control but not sure how much of that you would use. In summary the car is excellent in terms of handling and well grounded, the features are there but for the price I paid I expected much more. Overall, if you would really like a Jeep with all the bells and whistled go for a Longitude Optional or Limited. Happy and safe driving.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'I am an Air Force Officer and was impressed by the Jeep 4X4 month offer and went to a dealer in Bangalore for enquiring about the same. I had carried my cheque book to book the vehicle in anticipation of an honest interaction with the sales personI first asked him about the CSD price list. He said that he doesn\\'t have it. From the tone and tenour of his reply It appeared that he was giving me the concession and not the government. Then I enquired about the 4X4 month. Initially he was skirting the issue, and on my insistance and pointing out to a promo lying on the table, he confirmed there was such a scheme. I told him that I am waiting for some money as my mutual fund has matured and hence would book it ASAP. To this he said that I must book it immediately. He said that if the vehicle is delivered in May, then I will not get the offer. I replied to him that the information I have is that if I book it before 30 Apr, I will be able to avail it. He again repeated that if the deliver is in May then he cannot give me the offer. I was feeling that I was not sitting with a salesman of a reputed brand like Jeep. It was like sales at gunpoint ......\"I cant say prices will increase etc........\" It was like sitting on the edge of a cliff waiting to be pushed off The product is very good, but this is not the end. But arrogant people like this waiting to I have to go to these kind of people for service for the rest of the vehicles life. It is very difficult to do that after today\\'s experince. When they can renege on their word today, they will do it every day. A conf call with the dealer was arranged and the person at the dealership was relatively polite now, but I was too disturbed to reconsider the issue Hence I have glad that I did not sink my money into this unwelcome pit',\n",

As we drove down the highways, the car felt well planted and I didn?t have to switch gears very frequently in order to keep the car moving, which made it pretty relaxing to drive. But when we came back in the city, the heavy clutch started to get irritating and painful. The infotainment system offered with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will not disappoint you but it would have been better if it had a large screen in place. I quite liked the car and I would like to get one myself but the unavailability of an automatic transmission is a deal breaker for me.

Tucson with discount offers between 1-1.5 L is going to be available for almost the same price as the AT 4x4 Compass. Therefore a Tucson which is bigger, more powerful, more fuel efficient, better dynamically designed, more reliable, better ASS network, better looking ( depends on ones own taste), drives more like a sedan ( most of ones driving is going to be on metalled roads), needs serious considerations.As far as brand value (snob value ) is concerned worldwide Hyundai sells more Tucson than Jeep selling compass and has better ratings.In fact Jeep products are at the bottom of the rung. Now the present compass may be a new vehicle and may behave differently but it is still untested. A short test drive is not enough to test a vehicle which is going to cost more than 25 L.\\nWe Indians need to think more with our brains than our heart. A known enemy is better than an unknown friend.\\nFolks it is your hard earned money. You should get the best value for it.\\nAnd it is you who has to decide, finally.',\n",

Joy, Sumit, Shobith and two more from sales, Anand from CRM, including GM i spoke, multiple calls to Jeep customer care Tejas, Hrishkesh and one more always picked the call after a long waiting, they will just tell you that they are will arrange the call with dealer and soon you would get car but no call back. No escalation matrix in jeep india, only call center but no one from jeep india will come in the call when you ask for escalation.\\nSales team was keep on giving fake date of delivery, blame jeep India for not giving enough car to them, but always promise that entire group is working on ur issue. Those who have booked the jeep compass, i can bet, you won?t get in next six month also. Its not waiting period or due to demand. Looks like they have no plan to deliver cars in India, its just for export to other countries. Those who feel from Jeep that its famous brad and you and your dealer make Indian buys fool, then you guys are wrong. We have enough option, when this type of problem comes before getting car, we can imagine post sales services.\\nThose who don?t trust on my word, let me know, i will share recorded calls from Landmark Mathura road Delhi dealer and Jeep call center and whatsapp message how they make their customer fool. Worst experience i have ever seen, same complaint from so many guys who booked long back but still waiting (you won?t even get your car in 2018 also). Sympathy to those who are booking car now (you would be lucky if you get the car in 2019). One of the sales guys from landmark delhi dealer told be in frustration that they got only 2 cars in 25 days so how come we can give you any date for august month booking.\\nThose who have booked the jeep compass car, ask the delivery date to dealer, you won?t get same answer.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"Was looking to move on from my good old Mitsubishi Outlander - Yes a petrol suv :). Not a Diesel fan. Criteria was : An SUV, Chic Looks, Automatic Petrol. not much choices available in Indian market.\\nShortlisted between :\\nFortuner Petrol & Tucson Petrol . Then read some where jeep is launching Petrol with automatic .. so thought should give it a try & thank heavens I did that..!\\nResult : Booked the Car same day - a Sunday & guess what got delivery on Thursday same week .. wow :) what an experience.. Have drive 300 KM till now, and from my place of work to people on road, to my society, people just can't stop talking about the way it looks .. RED beast with black top..! At 22 Lacs -- super engine, upmarket interior and a fabulous planted ride both in city and highway.. you can't ask more .. plus for us Indians - chance to own a JEEP -- not a fake JEEP but original JEEP.. If anyone is thinking of buying it -- don't think twice .. just go for it.. you won't regret a second of owning it!! With govt regulations being stricter on diesel cars/suv.. this JEEP petrol automatic is the best available SUV over 20 LACs you can buy.. as far as 4*4 how of us.. had or will actually use it in future? Its just a badge for which you pay more and hardly use!\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"I bought the Jeep Compass just for its head-turning looks. But to my amazement, the Compass has a lot more to offer. The ride quality is sublime and so is the seating comfort. Although the high door sills do get in the way at times, especially when you are in a hurry. The sound system is amazing but I can't say the same for the infotainment display. Yes, it has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility but there's a noticeable lag in its operation. I have bought the 2.0-litre Limited variant without the 4x4 system. Up until now, I am more than satisfied with the Compass. But as I mentioned above, there are some drawbacks. But then that's the case with all cars I believe. To finish it off, I would just like to add that if you want something different and capable at the same time, the Jeep Compass will not disappoint you.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"After months of waiting fr it's launch, I booked the top-end 4x4 on the first day the bookings opened.\\nI am now going to cancel my booking. Reasons:\\n1. No delivery of 4x4 till Nov.\\n2. Imminent increase in taxes, & the On-Road Price will go frm 24 to 26 Lacs\\n3. Pay 26L fr a top-end vehicle, and you still have dummy buttons on the steering, undersized LCD with an odd plastic frame to cover the gap, & most importantly, NO SUN ROOF\\n4. 70000 diff between Limited & (O), All you get is a Black Roof & HIDJeep is making vehicles with Sun Roof, even the Trailhawk in Pune, but only for export. I can live without the Auto Wipers / Headlights / Cruise Control, but no Sunroof on a 26 Lac (mid-size) car.. doesn't work for me.\\nWhile the entry level Compass is priced right, the top-end is overpriced, considering Jeep is palming off an incomplete product to Indian customers.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"I have been a huge fan of Jeep badge. The sturdy and macho vehicles that this American brand manufactures are simply unmatchable. I have been following the Jeep Compass since the time it was first showcased. The massive road presence and the sharp styling of the Compass SUV cannot be compared to any other crossover in the country. Apart from this, its tyres will get your heart racing, they are just fantastic.The crossover is fully loaded but the biggest surprise came in the form of the price. Just Rs 14.95 lakh! I am amazed with Jeep's pricing strategy, it undercuts almost all its rivals and is definitely here to rule the Indian automotive arena. The other plus points of the Compass is the availability in both the petrol and diesel engines. Another important bit of the Jeep SUV is the Jeep Active Drive 4x4 system which disconnects rear axle and effortlessly keeps on switching between 4x2 and 4x4 drive types to ensure one gets the 4x4 capability only when it's essential, thus saving the extra effort of the vehicle. I am sure it must be helping out on the fuel efficiency numbers as well. With the Compass, a new beast of performance is here. I am keeping my fingers crossed and will be watching how the sales of the Compass take off. However, the more critical aspect is how Jeep is able to tackle the after-sales service of the Compass in a country obsessed with 'cheap and best' philosophy.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"I saw the Jeep Compass at a nearby dealership today. It is smaller than what it looks in the images. The Tucson, in comparison, looks wider. Sit inside and the quality of the materials used is good. The space is also decent and two six-feet tall guys can sit one behind the other. But it doesn't look as wide as you think it will be. From the driver's seat, it feels as if you're sitting in a vehicle of Creta's size. After sitting in the Compressed, sorry Compass, I felt that the starting price of around Rs 15 lakh is fair, and not very aggressive. Also, considering the reliability issues with the brand in most other markets, even if you are saving some money upfront, it'll be used up on the SUV only, and may not count as savings. There were a lot of people out there to check the Compass in the dealership and it looks like it will sell in good numbers. But I think I'll wait to see how Jeep fares in the after-sales department. I'm not sure if they'll be able to manage it.\",\n",
