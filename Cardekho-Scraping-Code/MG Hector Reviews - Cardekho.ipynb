      "People say that the electronics won't work out in India but MG has proved almost everyone wrong. Speaking of electronics, the car is fully loaded with advanced technology and none of them feels like it's overdone. My second point is the mileage, Hector is an SUV but still offers great mileage of around 16kmpl. The dimensions of the car are humungous. In terms of comfort, the car can beat any of its rivals and is also prepared to compete with upper-class SUVs like Fortuner, Endeavour, etc. I recently went on a road trip in my hector and the ride quality was amazing, the suspensions were pretty soft providing a clean ride. Though the car is pretty huge, it is easily drivable in the city without any problem. I've heard it is also called the internet car due to the presence of a massive touch screen system with a pretty clear voice assistant. It manages to recognize the Indian accent as well. The pricing of the car is pretty neat and is the best car in the segment.\n",

      "Best and brilliant car by MG. If we compare the cars in Hector's price range Jeep compass is overprized, no premium features, and no comfort. Tata Harrier is fair and the interior is worst. The segment king Hyundai Creta is just like I20 wearing heels it is not a car Worth buying. I waited for mg was confused in hector and Creta but Hector was just better than Creta in terms of design, features, interior. So those people planning to buy hector buy the smart model because of it worth buying and I have also bought the smart one. Very Smooth SUV and with safety. A superior look with great Interior. When we talk about feature all upgrade and fully internet SUV.\n",

      "I drove MG Hector (Sharp) Petrol Hybrid for more than 1000kms. Both in city traffic (200km) and on national highway (800km). It gives superior comfort for drivers/passengers. HiTech features make you feel like you are in full control of the car. No complaints in this section. Overall I am very happy. After driving it on different roads in city & highways, I don't feel the acceleration is leaner enough in all gears. Overall I felt it is \"sluggish\" / \"underpowered.\" The fuel efficiency is not up to the figures declared by MG India (i.e. 15.8 kmpl). I only got 9 to 10 kmpl in city & 11 to 13kmpl in Highways. Finally, I would like to say this car is a good value for money.\n",

      "Got a chance to drive this car. I didn't expect that the petrol hybrid engine gives this type of power. This engine is really awesome. The 1.5 ltr hybrid engine gives a lot of power in the mid-range up-to 2000 rpm some amount of lag is there but it pulls up pretty quick. The safety features of this car are very good, 6 airbags, Abs, EBD, TC, Hill hold etc. The design of this car is awesome and the comfort is very good. The rear passenger gets a rear armrest, rear Ac vents and a good amount of space. The main attraction of this car is the internet Inside 10.4-inch huge touch screen. It's really awesome. The sound quality is also great. Pros:- 1. Value for money 2. Fully loaded, the features in this price are like Panoramic sunroof, 10-inch touch screen with android auto and apple car play with 5G sim support, electrically adjustable driver seat etc 3. Safety. Cons:- 1. The Breaking is okay, not that great.\n",

      "People say that the electronics won't work out in India but MG has proved almost everyone wrong. Speaking of the electronics, the car is fully loaded with advanced technology and none of them feels like it's overdone. My second point is the milage, hector is an SUV but still offers great mileage of around 16km/l. The dimensions of the car are humungous. In terms of comfort, the car can beat any of its rival and is also prepared to compete with upper-class SUVs like Fortuner, Endeavour, etc. I recently went on a road trip in my hector and the ride quality was amazing, the suspensions were pretty soft providing a clean ride. Though the car is pretty huge, it is easily drivable in the city without any problem. I've heard it is also called the internet car due to the presence of a massive touch screen system with a pretty clear voice assistant. It manages to recognize the Indian accent as well. The pricing of the car is pretty neat and is the best car in the segment.\n",

      "The length and wheelbase are the largest amongst its rivals, though the narrow girth and excessive rear overhang do throw proportions off a bit. The 17-inch wheels also look a size too small. Generous use of chrome means the Hector is big on bling and elements like the split LED DRLs and headlamps set up ensure the MG grabs attention. The MG's cabin is simply cavernous and there is plenty of space for five passengers and their luggage. Range-topping versions get a massive panoramic sunroof that only adds to the airy feel in the interior. There are lots of other goodies onboard and the features really are a draw in their own right. The much talked about a 10.4-inch touchscreen that comes armed with connectivity tech is the focal point on the dashboard. Material quality is largely good but you will find some less special bits in the interior as well. The MG Hector Diesel is 170 HP, 2.0-liter engine, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, packs enough grunt and impresses with its linear power delivery and refinement. A snappy clutch remains a pain point of the Fiat-sourced engine though. The MG Hector Petrol gets a 143 HP, 1.5-liter turbocharged unit with a 6-speed manual as standard and a 48 V mild-hybrid setup as an option. The petrol hybrid is easy-going but lacks oomph for quick overtakes. The dual-clutch transmission does add convenience to the package but it's not the slickest of gearboxes. The ride quality is fairly good at town speeds, but up the pace, and you'll get a fair bit of body movement on undulating surfaces. The MG doesn't feel as well tied down as rivals at triple-digit speeds either and the noticeable body roll also means it simply isn't a driver's car. The steering isn't the most fearsome but it is light at low speeds and makes it easy to maneuver the large SUV.\n",

Very comfortable for front and rear passengers but disappointed with the mileage as it is only 5 - 7 KMPL, seriously. If you don't have issues with mileage this car is good and great. But don't waste your money on the hybrid model as in hybrid model they have put 48V lithium-ion battery under the driver seat, a rear passenger doesn't have enough and comfortable space for his/her legs.\n",

Though truly a rival for the Tata Harrier, Mahindra XUV500 and Jeep Compass in terms of its sheer size, keen pricing has also placed it precariously close to the likes of the Hyundai Creta.\n",

It uses the best engines, it has the best infotainment, best speakers, best aesthetic looks, imposing front grille, biggest sunroof, largest boot, best AI, most comfortable seating and what not. You ask for a feature and its there. This also happens to be the most fuel-efficient car in the segment. But then again when you buy a car worth 19 Lakhs do you really look for efficiency? No, I don't think so. Had this car been anything german then it would probably have costed thrice the current price. This car is indeed a head-turner. You grab the attention of other cars on the road when you drive this massive beast. \n",

      "I own a petrol hybrid MG Hector and the experience has been amazing to date. Have completed 2k kms. 1. The engine : sufficient power for this sized car. I initially thought the power to weight ratio would be evident when it comes to pulling the car, but I haven't experienced lack of power in most scenarios. The noise and vibrations are so low that sometime you wouldn't even know if the car is switched ON. 2. Driveability : light steering & clutch plus smooth gear transmission, it's an amazing combination to have especially if you drive a lot in the city. On the highway the steering doesn't feel very light, so you have sufficient control over the vehicle. Around the corners there definitely is the trademark SUV crossover bodyroll. If you are sitting in the rear seat, then you can be assured that you are sitting in the most comfortable space which you wouldn't get in any car. 3. Fuel efficiency: 6th gear and 80-120kms is the sweet spot for this car. Put it in this range and ull set records with the mileage. Mine clocks 19-21 km/L in this range. Within city under heavy traffic conditions I get 7-9km/L. 4. Infotainment system: a lot have complained on the sluggishness of the system, and even I felt the system to be slow. The latest update has fixed this issue. The system is smoother now. With a USB connected you can view photos and videos as well. 5. Space and overall comfort: the hector scores a 11/10 over here.. 10/ 10 with the sunroof closed and 11 with an open sunroof. Overall this is an awesome car in this segment and should be an obvious pick for anyone who is looking out to by am SUV crossover between 15 to 23Lakhs on-road price.\n",

      "I like the front grill of MG Hector especially the DRLS alongwith the indicators. When I sat inside the hector it felt wow because the interior looks like you are sitting in a living room with a 10 inches display along with a navigation and GPRS. Voice command is also very great. I love the front of the car but at the back, it looks like an Audi as it has been given an Audi like finish. The second row is very spacious and it feels very airy due to its panoramic sunroof and its large windows can never make a person claustrophobic. It gives a tough comparison to Ford Endeavour and Toyota Fortuner. I hope that by early 2020 MG Hector 7-seater will be released and also the BS6 complain will also be launched. It's fun to drive the car. I am very happy to have one car if MG Hector.\n",

Its slim body gives a very VIP look. It's gorgeous in every way, although its width is a little bit weird but the cuttings and edges are so perfect that it just covers the width problem. It's interior, my goodness can't explain it in words. So beautifully arranged.. furnished and polished. Buttons and A/C systems.. all perfect. Although the seats are a little bit uncomfortable for a tall person it can be managed.. It depends upon the people's adjusting. I ve heard so far that engine is even good.. in every single way excluding mileage but the acceleration and the adrenaline just couldnt be better.\n",

First, we have to go through the specifications (which mainly I liked ) *1956 cc engine *168 bhp *50+ connected features *25+ std safety features This is the specifications personally I liked more. Now we have to talk about, Pros :  *Design, *Full led lights, *Big infotainment system, *Boot space. Realy apart from these there are lots of good things are there Now I noticed some minor Cons :  *Quality of interior, *I think it may feel some uncomfortable for 6 feet person to site in the back seat. Other than this the MG Hector is awesome. The price and all other is super in this car . But one biggest question is arising in my mind, what about services and car accessories where we get this all. I think the price of the accessories of this is quite high because they have to import it from there country.\n",

Its front design gives it a modern and futuristic look and this look is future proof so your car won't feel old ever after many years... It's very practical, it's huge display is awesome but it could have been more awesome if they added a 90-hertz refresh rate to it , but the current refresh rate is not overall bad and it's very satisfying... Its sunroof is the main thing which you won't get in any other cars in this price segment its dimensions are great... I love it... If you want a strong futuristic car that will get highlighted on the road, MG Hector is the one for you.\n",

      "Regret the day I decided to purchase MG Hector. It took two weeks after delivery of the car to get the documentation in order. However, the worse nightmare was to follow: 1. On highway driving, the mileage of the MG Hector (Petrol) is 8.76 (tank full to tank full)! This is shocking. 2. Air-conditioning is very poor. At L1 (coolest) setting and at an ambient temperature of fewer than 35 degrees, it was uncomfortable inside the car. 3. The pick-up is very poor. Even on a small slope, and at low gear (2 or 3), the car struggles to move. 4. Many of the so-called \"high tech\" features do not work. On the plus side, the vehicle is spacious and four (not five) persons can sit comfortably. I am sorry that credible websites like you and others did not bring out these obvious deficiencies when you reviewed this vehicle.\n",

      "Hello, this is just a review after doing 4000 km on diesel top-end variant. I will not get into looks and interiors as so many people have written on it. I would just focus on my 4000 km travel experience. Did hill as well as national and state highway driving? Touched 170 km/h speed. Car is excellent to drive and braking at high-speed is fantastic. No vibration or sitting while breaking, just stops straight. On the bridge, joints do not jump or shake. Would rate it better than a Fortuner or Q5 which I have driven on some roads (Lucknow to Delhi). Hill driving did between Kanpur and shaktinagar. On hill, I find the car has less power especially when u change gears. The car has a perfect grip on hill turns. The car gave me an average fuel consumption of 18 between Kanpur and shaktinagar. Very comfortable seats just don't feel tired. Everything was perfect except for two issues. 1. headlights need improvement as on rainy night visibility gets bad. 2. Wiper blades need some improvement as it leaves some foggy impression on the glass for a second.\n",

      "I took a test drive on the new nice looking car called MG. Yes, it's a good looking car and fully loaded with top features that the competitors do not have till I am writing this but, I expect that Hyundai will make the new car to make a tough competition for them. MG driving experience (diesel), I noticed the engine sound is a bit lower than the compass and the harrier. It gives good power. wheel spin is controlled, but I noticed one issue that space (gap) between the clutch pedal and the dead pedal is low its bit discomfort for the driver. the suspension is supreme but doesn't know the condition at corners. Music system (infinity) is supreme, but the white cloth-like cover for the sunroof has no quality. The wheel size could be better. the instrument cluster is not up to the mark. Other wise its a nice car waiting for a face lift of this model.\n",

Display touch: Touch is not that much responding as expected. one can say that Touch is the same as in Chinese mobile. 3. cooling issue: Rear seat passenger is going to face this issue in Hot weather. Rear vent cooling is not as per the expectations. Due to the sunroof, rear seats have a much higher temperature. 4. The biggest issue which the one will face is the battery issue. Even MG knows that its battery is not that much perfect that's why MG is giving a 1-year warranty on the battery.\n",

The panoramic sunroof looks good. I have dropped my idea to my Ford Endeavor. White color looks wow. The rear seat is adjustable with the different seating position. The ground clearance is ok. The engine with 2.0,  it produces 170 bhp. The decent turning radius of 5.2.boot space is 589 liter. Six airbags and 17 inches tyres and a Stepney with 17-inch tyre. Three spokes steering with height and reach adjustable. Rain-sensing viper's. Pressure and temperature monitoring system. Accua weather app and gaana app and many more.\n",

      "MG Hector is a huge hit in India. Booking numbers are over 15,000 units in about 15 days post launch. Waiting period in most cities has touched 7 months, and increasing. With production of Hector limited to just 2,000 units a month, it is going to be a long wait for most buyers. The good news is that deliveries have started, and are in full swing Just like the Hector, there is another SUV which is all set for India launch, that has managed to garner a similar kind of buzz; and that is the Kia Seltos. With all the details about Kia Seltos now available, it is time to take a look at both MG Hector and Kia Seltos specs on paper. MG Hector and Kia Seltos are both equipped with connected car technologies, come in with an array for first in segment features and brim over with driver and passenger conveniences and comforts. They are both well equipped in terms of safety and both receive powerful engine lineup. The MG Hector is officially launched in India whereas the Kia Seltos is slated for launch on 22nd August 2019. Despite their similarities, there are some vital differences which are detailed below; Exterior Design and Features ? MG Hector is offered in four trims ? Style, Super, Smart and Sharp and color schemes of Candy White, Aurora Silver, Glaze Red, Starry Black and Burgundy Red. It boasts of a tall stance and commanding road presence. It is fitted with a large front grille with extensive use of chrome in its makeup, all LED lamps at the front and rear and side indicators along with silver finished skid plates, 17? dual tone alloy wheels and squared wheel arches. The silver finished roof rails and large panoramic sunroof enhance its sporty appeal along with chrome elements at the rear and a chrome bar that is positioned above the license plate. Dimensions ? MG Hector boasts of larger dimensions as compared to the Kia Seltos even though both are compact SUVs. The Hector stands 4,655mm in length, 1,835mm in width and 1,760mm in height. It gets a wheelbase of 2,750mm. On the other hand, the Kia Seltos stands distinctively shorter in length at 4,315mm while width is at 1,800mm, height at 1,620mm and wheelbase at 2,610mm. These dimensions could mean that the cabin of the Seltos would be a bit cramped as compared to that seen on the Hector while boot space will also be more spacious in the Hector as compared to that of the Seltos. Interior Features, Safety and Technology ? Interiors of the MG Hector boast of a neat design. The seats are comfortable and well bolstered with contouring for better passenger comforts and done up in soft touch upholstery in contrasting leather. The 10.4? full HD touchscreen sees fewer buttons. There are piano black inserts seen on the central console with grey accents on the dashboard enhancing its premium appeal. Where safety is concerned, compliance to new safety norms bring in electronic stability program, hill assist, cruise control, powered seats and 360 degree camera, rear parking sensors, 6 airbags, ABS and EBD as standard. MG Hector is the first connected compact SUV to launch in India. It woos tech savvy buyers in India with its array of advanced in-car technologies for which the company has linked up with global tech partners such as like Microsoft, Adobe, SAP, Cisco, Nuance, Gaana, TomTom and Unlimit. This car also receives Internet Protocol version 6, making it 5G ready and the e-SIM is provided by Airtel and MG Motors offering internet connectivity for the complete warranty period. Kia Seltos also commands well designed interiors with comfortable seating, an 8 speaker sound system from Bose, a first in segment 10.25? touchscreen infotainment system and a 7? color TFT unit for the instrument console. There is a bounty of safety features offered on the Kia Seltos. These include ABS, EBD, ECS, 6 airbags, traction control, stability management, hill start assist, brake assist, front and rear parking cameras and a 360 degree camera for all round visibility. The occupant cell has been designed for maximum protection in the event of a crash with high steel and deformation zones to absorb impact. Kia calls its connected technology as UVO which can be accessed via a smartphone. It offers a total of 37 connectivity features with roadside assistance and SOS to alert a call center in the event of an emergency. Price ? MG Hector is priced between Rs.12.18 lakhs and Rs.16.88 lakhs. Kia has not yet disclosed pricing of the upcoming Seltos which could be offered in a much lower price bracket starting from as low as Rs.11 lakhs going up to Rs.16 lakhs for the top end variant.\n",

I am driving a CRV auto and this guy puts it to shame. Did visit KIA to look at the Seltos and it sure is another winner but through sheer size and the panoramic sunroof, Hector leaves it behind.\n",

It will be going up against rivals such as the Tata Harrier, Jeep Compass and Hyundai Tuscon.

      "What's it like on the outside? The Hector is certainly a head-turner and it drew quite an audience everywhere and every time we stopped for photos on the picturesque route from Coimbatore to Coonoor. The nose has lots of interesting detailing and follows the current trend where the headlight cluster is placed down at bumper level with the LED DRLs sitting above where the lights typically should be. The humongous grille, which you just can?t miss, feels a touch oversized, even on a car so big though. The blade-like DRLs further accentuate the size of the grille and look great when illuminated. There's a good dose of chrome, of course, used liberally around the grille, and C-shaped headlight housings. The prominent air intake in the lower bumper and massive skid plate look the part and give the Hector serious SUV credibility.\n",

      "Highly anticipated Hector mow launched at a staggering price of 12.18 lakhs ex-showroom PAN India and it is super value for money and well suited for family kind of person. Hector has the biggest dimensions in its segment and really impresses on the space department. the boot is also the largest and ample for long picnics with the family. The engines are powerful, 2.0 diesel is very powerful and efficient and the 1.5-liter turbo petrol is also offered in DCT and 48v battery for efficiency and boost in power. The hector is very advanced in technology department as it comes with connected car technologies like geofencing and tomtom live maps and many more! The overall ride quality is awesome but it suffers on handling department because of massive dimensions and soft suspension but it doesn't matter a lot and not a deal breaker. On the reliabily front, the hector comes with a 5-year warranty and many schemes to attract customers. MG has also collaborated with Cardekho to improve customer satisfaction. Mg hector is really impressive and an overall great product.\n",

      "Dear all, rating this car at 5 stars is just through brainstorming and comparing with one I intend to buy in the last 1 months have taken test drive for all except MG, standing in comparison will be XUV500 W11option, Jeep Compass, hairier, T crysta, Skoda Superb, Civic, CRV both petrol n diesel. Alturas. I say MG yes, infotainment screen, front design, wheelbase, ground clearance(192) other in this segment are high 190-210mm,but yes front cluster, digital speedo, quality of plastics and inside cabin material, automatic seat and co-driver also, with thigh support, excellent voice command, remote controls, remote car view etc are great luxury features, yes the tag or MG looks great, overall I am now going for it with just a small price of 22-23 lakhs on road price for diesel variant. Only negative may be if service and car resale value flop! but still you will have head tilted once you are on road, I m sure!\n",

      "By looking at the specifications and features, MG Hector seems to be a strong contender in its segment. It excels in every department be it engine, features, design, space. It comes with many segment-first features like an internet-based vertically mounted 10.4 inches infotainment system, a full panoramic sunroof, connected car features, etc that make it more appealing to the Indian consumer. Apart from features, MG Hector is also very well equipped in terms of safety. Safety features like dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, ESP, traction control, all four disc brakes, hill hold assist, and ISOFIX child seat mounts are stand across the range. Only if MG can price the Hector aggressively, somewhere between 15-20 Lakh then I think it will be a value for money option for buyers in the segment. As MG is a new brand in the Indian automotive market, it will be interesting to see how MG handles the sale and service of its vehicles. To me, MG Hector seems to be a solid competitor to other vehicles in its segment. It seems to be a sensible choice for someone who is looking to buy a well built and feature-rich SUV under 20 Lakhs. Only time will tell how well the MG brand performs in the Indian automotive market.\n",

      "MG Hector is beautifully designed with a lot of space and segment first features. The Petrol Engine fills the gap between 1200-1600cc and comes with an auto gearbox too. Interiors are beautifully done. The outer looks are to die for. The connected 10.4-inch screen is a big plus for feature lovers. In India, for most people, 15 lakhs is a sort of mental barrier. The Creta is overpriced by a lot for a lot fewer features. The Harrier doesn't offer good features in lower models but is priced very competitively. The SUV market in India is growing and if MG Hector is rightly priced (say 13 lakhs onwards), it will be a definite Winner.\n",

      "When I hear that car is coming to India which will be the first Indian electric SUV, I am surprised about that. This car's look is not so crispy as much as Tata's harrier, but it damns electric beast. This car doesn't shine us, this car speaks to us. Every Indian should purchase all car from MG brands only even though they are Chinese owned, reason that MG is an electric car. At least Indian pollution will be reduced instead of Globalisation of car trading across the world. If Tesla comes to Indian Market it will take 250% more import charge as much as 85 lakh rupees for just 25 lakh rupees tesla in the US states. Hats off to China for doing something changes to Indian environment. The reason why I am supporting China. Indians don't have the hope to produce own electric car even they are electrical engineers and the other hand government don't provide fund for an electric vehicle startup project. They don't care about success. But MG does. It provides their SUV not sedan in just between 15 to 20 lakh. I hope I may be the first customer. Thinking you. Yours, Pratik Bagale Founder of Rakalp Giant.\n",
