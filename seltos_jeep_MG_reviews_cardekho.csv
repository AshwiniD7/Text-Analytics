Cardekho.com,Kia Seltos,"Getting into and out of the Seltos is easy and what is sure to impress is the sheer level of quality in the interior; material quality and fit-finish are up there with pricier European cars. The dashboard is neatly laid out and usefully places the infotainment system high up and in the driver?s line of sight. Top-spec Seltos? get slick 10.2-inch touchscreens, the instrument cluster is easy to read and there?s even head-up display. A powered driver?s seat, ventilated front seats, ambient lighting, a 360-degree parking camera, and even an onboard air purifier are other features offered on the Seltos. Front seat comfort is good but the rear seat does lose some points for the somewhat lack of thigh support. While not the roomiest of SUVs for the price, the Seltos offers plenty of space and features like a retractable backrest and retractable sun visors also enhance the rear seat experience.  While we are yet to try out all engine-gearbox options on offer, we did come away very impressed with the 1.5 diesel-manual and the 1.4 turbo-petrol autos. The 115hp diesel is very refined and performance is pleasant. A slick gearbox and a well-weighted clutch also make it easy to live with. Those looking for a sporty drive will find a good match in the 140hp, 1.4 turbo-petrol. The engine is smooth, strong and very likable. Also good is the 7-speed dual-clutch auto that is responsive and quick to shift. What's missing are paddle shifters.  The Kia Seltos is easy to drive. The steering requires reasonable effort and weights up well enough at higher speeds. Ride comfort is good too with nice low-speed bump absorption and confident high-speed manners",5,Suraj Yadav,17-Nov-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/kia-seltos/best-car-of-the-year-93899.htm

Cardekho.com,Kia Seltos,Kia's cars come with comparatively cheaper prices than of similar brands. But includes great looks and suspension in comparison to other cars of the segment. ,5,Prateek Chadhary,13-Aug-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/kia-seltos/pratik-chawdhary-78351.htm
Cardekho.com,Kia Seltos,Seltos is the best car in its segment. There can not be any better car than this. Every feature is just mind-blowing. Strongly recommended.,5,Anonymous,13-Aug-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/kia-seltos/strong-recommendation-kia-seltos-78297.htm
Cardekho.com,Kia Seltos,"One of the most futuristic-looking cars, in my opinion, it's better than MG Hector or the Tata Harrier, Seltos gives a very punchy performance and the power delivery is very linear you just have to press the gas pedal and the rpm meter goes right up to the 5000 rpm, mark it gives an excellent performance, hats off to Kia motors. The Kia Seltos is the 3rd car in India after Hyundai Venue and MG Hector to get a connected tech called UVO meaning your voice and has 37 features. The UVO app can be used to control functions like remote engine start/ stop, door lock/ unlock, voice based commands and remote vehicle status among others. Kia has partnered with Vodafone to provide connectivity solutions along with many other tech companies like MapMyIndia and LG. Move inside the cabin and you will be taken aback by the design and layout. There are a variety of trim options right from an all-black theme to dual tone and more. The overall layout remains the same with a cockpit inspired design. The highlight, of course, is the large horizontally placed 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system that's intuitive to operate. The system adjoins the instrument cluster having a 7-inch digital display and looks modern, not only the Seltos is feature-rich, but it's also mechanically rich. Kia has added a variety of engine and gearbox options in the Seltos to cater a wide audience and growing demand of the buyers. To be precise, there are 3 engine options and four gearbox options combined to form 16 variant options. The one we drove during our first-drive review was the 1.5-litre diesel engine with an automatic gearbox. Before talking about the driving experience, here's a brief idea about the engine options. There's a 1.5-litre petrol engine developing 115 PS and 144 Nm output mated to either a 6-speed manual or a CVT gearbox. There's the 1.5-litre diesel with 115 PS and 250 Nm output mated to a 6-speed manual and 6- speed automatic unit, the one which got to drive. And lastly, the talk of the town 1.4-litre turbo petrol producing 140 PS and 242 Nm and is mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed DCT. All the engines are BS-VI ready. There are 3 drive modes - Normal, Eco and Sport and three traction modes - Mud, Snow and Sand to choose from, however, there's no physical knob to easily opt between these modes. There's no all-wheel drive system either. Talking about the drive experience, the diesel engine had a minimal turbo lag with a linear delivery and a very good low-end torque. The auto gearbox responded well with the engine and it was not difficult doing three digit speeds even on narrow Goan roads. The flat-bottom steering not only felt good to hold but also had balanced feedback for city and highway driving. It was not difficult to take sharp turns, though it felt a bit heavier at times. The ride quality was fabulous and it felt like Kia had worked hard to tune suspension as per the Indian roads. We took the car through water clogged roads, broken patches and highway and the Seltos did not disappoint us. The NVH levels were refined and no diesel clutter or instant acceleration noise seeped inside the cabin. The braking was confident too, and heavy rains didn't affect the braking force much. In terms of mileage, Kia claims 16+ kilometres to a litre for both the petrol engines and 21 kmpl for the diesel engine with a manual gearbox.",5,Xczxzcc,10-Aug-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/kia-seltos/kia-seltos-above-all-77484.htm

Cardekho.com,Kia Seltos,"Based on my onscreen review, one of the best SUV to hit the market with its maiden entry into the Indian market. As the images and video reveals it has everything that Creta lacks as far as exterior design is concerned especially the rear view. A big but well designed SUV Seltos touches deep to my heart with marvelous front, beating the MG Hector, heart touching rear beating the Hyundai Creta and the boot space, ground clearance, length, breadth, height, and power is almost same as that of XUV500, MG Hector and Tata Harrier. But it is the pricing that matters in the Indian market. Price it properly to avoid the undesired results as it happened in case of Jeep Compass. Trust me the Indians will compromise with safety features but not with design and pricing. Believe me, this SUV is going to rock the market with the sporty design but pricing that worries me. Don't forget what is happening to Jeep Compass as it is priced beyond the buyer's expectations. In the end best of luck to Kia, a sister company of Hyundai to compete not only with its brother Hyundai but also with all the SUVs currently available in the Indian market.",4,Sukhjinder Singh,26-Jun-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/kia-seltos/marvellous-rocking-suv-68334.htm

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone.

Jeep Compass comes with safety features such as traction control, rollover mitigation, ESP, Electronic Parking Brake, Hill Assist, Hill Descent Control as standard. Jeep compass build quality, interior design, and quality are top-notch. There are some pros and cons of Compass as follows:- PROS 1. Class-leading off-roading capabilities. 2. The diesel engine is extremely frugal and responsive. 4. Dominant seven-slat grille, the sharp proportions, and the rectangular arches have succeeded in catching the attention of many Indians. There are a lot of Compass customers in India who praise its design more than anything. 5. 6 Speed Manual Gearbox is very smooth. 6. Owing to off-road character, compass gets four driving modes in its Selec- Terrain all-wheel-drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand, and Mud- the systems adjust the engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7. The individual Suspension set up of the jeep compass further increases its off-road capability. 8. Plastic quality and materials used on the compass are extremely superb and best in class. CONS 1. Missing some features. 2. Poor rear seat comfort feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3. Too much expensive. 4. 7-speed DCT Automatic gearbox is not very smooth, quickest and lacks punch. 5. The petrol engine is noisy than other rivals such as Creta and hector. 6.

It slid about 150 meters. Due to Seat belt on me and my friend were safe with injuries on the chest.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"My name is Johnson Correya and I currently reside in Powai (Mumbai). I have purchased a petrol model Jeep Compass Sports Variant with Manual Transmission. Before buying the vehicle, I had checked reviews on different websites about this vehicle and discussed the features with the sales team, especially with the salesperson from the Landmark Mumbai showroom (Abhishek). All automobile related sites and the salesman had claimed that the mileage for this model is 14-17 km/liter. I don't have any other problems with this model except the mileage for which I am getting an average of 5 to 5.5 km/liter with a mixture of conditions like traffic, without traffic and high way etc. I approached the CRM Mr. Salim who asked me to bring the car for a check-up. I dropped the vehicle off on 14/11/18 after completing 1200 km. I had reset the meter just before I dropped the vehicle at the service center. Service adviser Prateek attended my vehicle and suggested me to come back after 3 days as they wanted to test the entire vehicle. I complied and collected the vehicle after 3 days had elapsed. While I was collecting the vehicle, he informed me that they had checked the vehicle in traffic conditions and they had gotten 10 km/liter with no other technical issues in the vehicle. They have written the average mileage as 10 km/liter in the service form. I checked the mileage meter just after leaving the service center then I realized that the mileage was 4.5km/liter and they have driven the vehicle 14.5 km. It was a barefaced lie which they told me that they got 10 km/liter in traffic conditions. I had informed the mileage issue to the CRM (Salim) again. He had suggested that he would send one person with me to check my driving pattern. He had sent Aditya Dhere on 23.11.18 at 6 pm at my office. He accompanied me for 2 km in traffic conditions. He understood that the issue is with the mileage and not with my driving patterns. He had taken a picture of the mileage meter and sent it to the CRM. We got 2.2 km/liter for around 2 km drive with 25 minutes of travel. I don't travel always in traffic, 5-5.5 is an average of a mix (all conditions). It is not worth driving this vehicle with the kind of average I get and why the company is offering an impossible mileage of 14-17 km/liter is ludicrous and preposterous. They haven't given any solution till date. My humble request to the customers, please do not buy Jeep compass as they are selling the car with fake commitments.",1,Johnson,17-Jan-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/petrol-driking-mechine-avrage-56kml-27871.htm

I am getting an average mileage of 5-6KM/L after driving 2500km with different conditions.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"We are a family of four and we all are really fond of cars including my little one 2 years old as well. The elder 10 year old son can rattle the power and torque figures of different cars. Most of the cars we have owned are driving oriented and we always take the build quality, driving dynamics and safety as top priorities every time we choose a new car. Just to name the cars in our fleet in the past, we owned Ford Fiesta, Honda Civic, Skoda Yeti and Laura. All these cars gave brilliant experience with well sorted performance. But choosing the Yeti successor was quite a difficult task as the list of priorities increased all these years. We shortlisted the priorities which included nice driving dynamics, strong build quality and safety, leather steering wheel, leather seats, silent/powerful diesel engine, spaciousness, distinct styling and of course, the hill hold control since I have phobia of rolling back. So, fortunately we were able to shortlist the cars and the list included Renault Duster, Audi Q3, BMW X1, Skoda Kodiaq, VW Tiguan and Jeep Compass. The Audi and BMW were rejected due to fact that our regular drives to the outskirts where my grandparents live would prove a nightmare for these cars. Skoda Kodiaq and VW Tiguan were outrageously priced for what they offer while we listed out Renault Duster because it lacks adequate safety features. So, the last option remained in the list which was meeting all our expectations was Jeep Compass. Now coming to the initial experience, man, it's a head turner. Wherever I take my blazing red Jeep Compass, it really grabs eyeballs. It has pretty striking similarity with the Range Rover Evoque, especially the blackened roof. My wife is really smitten with this car, during the early drive of 40 kms, we drove equally for 30 kilometers. The car is exceptionally comfortable to drive with the engine barely audible from inside even if you cruise at the speed of 80kmph. The 2.0L engine produces 173PS and 350Nm of peak torque with the SUV giving above 16kmpl mileage in mix conditions which is pretty much acceptable given the stature of the car. With linear acceleration, the vehicle can reach the 80-90kmph mark in no time. The engine is quite smooth and does not have turbo lag unlike other cars we owned in the past. Coming to the part which I liked the most is the robust quality this car comes with. It is heavy especially the doors, hood and the tailgate. The car comes with all the safety aspects which we needed including dual airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill start assist, electronic parking brake and ISOFIX rear child seat mounts. The braking is adequate and it comes to halt in the straight line without any fuss. In terms of comfort inside, the car is an absolute bliss with enough legroom at the rear which most people complain about in the car. The car has all the contemporary gizmos including the 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto support and a very effective air conditioner. However, the sound output from the AV system was mediocre although one can always add extra speakers to increase the decibels. Driven over 3000kms so far and it has been a wonderful experience with this car. Anyone who wants a little show-off with utter cabin comfort, safety and smooth engine performance, I think Jeep Compass can be a good choice under Rs. 25 lakhs.",5,Shailendra,19-Nov-18,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-my-experience-after-driving-3000kms-21737.htm

They are committed for after sales service but they may have a practical issue with on -road service or stock issue as they are rising and not completely established. But Jeep is always known for Lavish driving and safety. If you are a passionate driver then this Car is for you. I drove almost 4000 KM in a month. I had a good experience. One more thing any variant of Jeep compass does not have any mechanical change except 4X4 ,6 Airbags and Tyre Size. All is about Exterior and Interior.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"Jeep Compass as the name strikes the mind, we get the image of the hardcore off-road Jeep-like vehicle but that?s not the case with the Jeep Compass. Though it?s a plush as well as off-roader it dons the typical city SUV looks. I bought my Jeep Compass in January 2018 and till date, it never failed to impress me in one way or the other. Its amazing performance and features are quite inspiring while its exterior and interior looks make one give a second glance for sure. Jeep Compass was first introduced in July 2017 in the Indian subcontinent making it as a strong player against other compact SUVs in this space. The vehicle was designed to look like a baby Grand Cherokee and gets some of the features from Jeep Renegade. The SUV features vertically slatted wide radiator grille, muscular front bumper, and high mounted headlamps. Side profile gets the prominent shoulder line and squared wheel arches while the rear portion is neatly finished. Inside, the first thing that catches the eye is the Uconnect infotainment unit that supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay placed at the center of the dashboard. The car also gets dual-zone automatic temperature control and seats are covered with Ski grey leather upholstery. For better safety, Jeep Compass comes loaded with numerous features such as dual front airbags, traction control, ABS and EBD. I own the powerful diesel engine that is the 2.0L motor that belts out 173PS of power and mated to six-speed manual gearbox.

Pros
Good build quality
Comfortable
Cons
Basic features missing like LED headlamps, cruise control.
Just 2 airbags
Audio system is no better than Maruti's

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"I bought limited(O) diesel from Mohali dealership on 10th January 2018 and I must say my experience till now is great in all aspects.When I confirmed my purchase, I got delivery next day as one day took for banking formalities. That was amazing experience. The dealership here in Mohali is very professional and customer oriented, they even changed the car before delivery as I found one paint issue in the previous car and they provided a new car. They gave me plenty of time to check and verify the car again till I got satisfied. Till now I have driven around 3350 kms and my experience is awesome either in city or highways. As Chandigarh/Mohali doesn't have traffic like Delhi or Mumbai, I am getting mileage of around 16.5 km/l and on highways it gave me maximum of 20.5 km/l while driving at maximum speed of 100 km/hour. I love the interiors, although maintenance is high as seat covers and doors are light colored as per my model but it looks premium. The music system is great as well electronic break, it is a great feature. Also You can manage other stuff within infotainment system like controlling lights, doors, phone etc. People are saying that it doesn't have cruise control but for me it is not essential as in India, roads are not build for it. When you are on highway, any animal or people can come in between. I think sunroof could be a good option if they add in the future as well automatic in diesel. I don't mind manual transmission but automatic is helpful when there are long traffic jams. As far as car's build is concerned, It is heavy build with great quality. On highway, I had a major accident when a Harley Davidson rammed into right front grill/bumper and to my surprise, It got nothing except a small scratch which was removed by dealership later on. I must say the quality is really good. Car is a head turner for sure, I have seen how people react when you are on road, it gives a personality and car looks very rugged and manly. I have heard bad reviews about dealership and services but nothing like this happened to me. Even they gave me training to use infotainment system as well the best way to maintain the car. They are available on one phone call. I am happy with my choice.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"I started following all the updates on this small SUV the moment it was announced for the Indian market. The key reason behind purchasing this car was the attractive design with which I fell in love at the first sight. And since it is a Jeep product, I wasn't caring much about the build quality and the driving experience. The ride and handling of the Jeep Compass certainly make it a true blue SUV, especially the high-speed stability and the way suspension gulps the potholes is beyond words. But honestly, this SUV is not perfect. The car is not spacious given its size. It also lacks some key features that should have been integrated by Jeep such as sunroof, auto headlights, cruise control and rain sensing wipers. So in my opinion, Jeep should address these issues asap since parent company Fiat does not have a good reputation in terms of sales and services. Although Jeep is giving 2 years/unlimited kms warranty on the car to encourage the buyers, still a lot more effort is needed from the company to turn the tables to its side.",3,Ravinder,13-Feb-18,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-attractive-suv-that-misses-some-key-features-19034.htm

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"Good to be back again?this time I am writing a review for the Jeep Compass Longitude Diesel MT. This is the mid segment jeep in the compass series. To start with let me tell you the vehicle is absolutely ?SOLID? heavy build and gives you an impeccable presence wherever you go. So lets talk engine dynamics, the diesel engine of this baby is a 2 Ltr Multijet diesel engine meshed with a 6 speed gear box yielding 173 PS power which is sufficient to propel this vehicle really fast. The acceleration is good but the pickup still might need some work. It can be blamed on the heavy build of the vehicle as the engine after all is 2 ltr. The breaking is pretty efficient as I did try the odd ball 60 KM/HR to ?0? breaking and the vehicle responded perfectly telling me that the ABS and EBD systems gelled perfectly. Let?s talk driving comfort now, although the gear shifts are smooth but the clutch does require some pushing and in city driving you might get a bit of a foot ache if you are not used to it. The vehicle can power down if you are at a low speed trying to drive at a higher gear. One thing I really loved was the electronic parking brake which replaced a hand brake with a nifty little button where the hand brake used to exist. Now coming to the ergonomics on this vehicle, the instrument cluster is well lit and the infotainment system has just the right features. I bought the Longitude and not the optional so features like car play and android auto were not available. They did provide a usb port in the rear which was pretty good. There were a couple of things which did disappoint like there was no climatronic AC, although the door handled has leathered upholstery the seats were fabric which was very disappointing and the Jeep accessory for the seat costed about 16000 MRP. The car has reverse parking sensors but no camera which is not one would expect after paying a good amount for this car and lets face it, it doesn?t cost much. Another things which was painful was that the car?s speaker system was absolutely flat no zing to it. The car does have traction control but not sure how much of that you would use. In summary the car is excellent in terms of handling and well grounded, the features are there but for the price I paid I expected much more. Overall, if you would really like a Jeep with all the bells and whistled go for a Longitude Optional or Limited. Happy and safe driving.",4,Samriddh Mangotra,27-Dec-17,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-a-great-value-for-money-suv-18826.htm
Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"I am an Air Force Officer and was impressed by the Jeep 4X4 month offer and went to a dealer in Bangalore for enquiring about the same. I had carried my cheque book to book the vehicle in anticipation of an honest interaction with the sales personI first asked him about the CSD price list. He said that he doesn't have it. From the tone and tenour of his reply It appeared that he was giving me the concession and not the government. Then I enquired about the 4X4 month. Initially he was skirting the issue, and on my insistance and pointing out to a promo lying on the table, he confirmed there was such a scheme. I told him that I am waiting for some money as my mutual fund has matured and hence would book it ASAP. To this he said that I must book it immediately. He said that if the vehicle is delivered in May, then I will not get the offer. I replied to him that the information I have is that if I book it before 30 Apr, I will be able to avail it. He again repeated that if the deliver is in May then he cannot give me the offer. I was feeling that I was not sitting with a salesman of a reputed brand like Jeep. It was like sales at gunpoint ......""I cant say prices will increase etc........"" It was like sitting on the edge of a cliff waiting to be pushed off The product is very good, but this is not the end. But arrogant people like this waiting to I have to go to these kind of people for service for the rest of the vehicles life. It is very difficult to do that after today's experince. When they can renege on their word today, they will do it every day.

The infotainment system offered with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will not disappoint you but it would have been better if it had a large screen in place.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"As and when Compass comes with AT 4x4 it will cost atleast 23.5 and obviously as it is a new launch there are no discount offers. Tucson with discount offers between 1-1.5 L is going to be available for almost the same price as the AT 4x4 Compass. Therefore a Tucson which is bigger, more powerful, more fuel efficient, better dynamically designed, more reliable, better ASS network, better looking ( depends on ones own taste), drives more like a sedan ( most of ones driving is going to be on metalled roads), needs serious considerations.As far as brand value (snob value ) is concerned worldwide Hyundai sells more Tucson than Jeep selling compass and has better ratings.In fact Jeep products are at the bottom of the rung. Now the present compass may be a new vehicle and may behave differently but it is still untested. A short test drive is not enough to test a vehicle which is going to cost more than 25 L.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"Very disappointed with Jeep India and their Dealers. Big brand but poor management in India. Fake data they are disclosing that 5000 cars has been delivered or 10000+ booking completed but actual data is wrong, very few cars on road, almost everyone is waiting and wasting their time. Dealers initially promise that they will deliver the car in first lot itself but you won?t get even status , just next day or next week. Those who call, they get answer from dealer and jeep india customer care that they will call back but you wont get call for days and weeks for status. Total failure in communication between Jeep FCA and dealers. Dealers would say that jeep is not giving cars and jeep would ask you to contact dealers or put you in conference call with dealers who will be not ur sales person, he will says that we have not yet given april/may month booking and long story they will tell you and indirectly they pass the message, either wait or go to hell.
All problem i have faced in last four months, booked the jeep compass petrol automatic from Landmark Mathura Road Delhi. Joy, Sumit, Shobith and two more from sales, Anand from CRM, including GM i spoke, multiple calls to Jeep customer care Tejas, Hrishkesh and one more always picked the call after a long waiting, they will just tell you that they are will arrange the call with dealer and soon you would get car but no call back. No escalation matrix in jeep india, only call center but no one from jeep india will come in the call when you ask for escalation.
Sales team was keep on giving fake date of delivery, blame jeep India for not giving enough car to them, but always promise that entire group is working on ur issue. Those who have booked the jeep compass, i can bet, you won?t get in next six month also. Its not waiting period or due to demand. Looks like they have no plan to deliver cars in India, its just for export to other countries. Those who feel from Jeep that its famous brad and you and your dealer make Indian buys fool, then you guys are wrong. We have enough option, when this type of problem comes before getting car, we can imagine post sales services.
Those who don?t trust on my word, let me know, i will share recorded calls from Landmark Mathura road Delhi dealer and Jeep call center and whatsapp message how they make their customer fool. Worst experience i have ever seen, same complaint from so many guys who booked long back but still waiting (you won?t even get your car in 2018 also). Sympathy to those who are booking car now (you would be lucky if you get the car in 2019). One of the sales guys from landmark delhi dealer told be in frustration that they got only 2 cars in 25 days so how come we can give you any date for august month booking.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"I have been a huge fan of Jeep badge. The sturdy and macho vehicles that this American brand manufactures are simply unmatchable. I have been following the Jeep Compass since the time it was first showcased. The massive road presence and the sharp styling of the Compass SUV cannot be compared to any other crossover in the country. Apart from this, its tyres will get your heart racing, they are just fantastic.The crossover is fully loaded but the biggest surprise came in the form of the price. Just Rs 14.95 lakh! I am amazed with Jeep's pricing strategy, it undercuts almost all its rivals and is definitely here to rule the Indian automotive arena. The other plus points of the Compass is the availability in both the petrol and diesel engines. Another important bit of the Jeep SUV is the Jeep Active Drive 4x4 system which disconnects rear axle and effortlessly keeps on switching between 4x2 and 4x4 drive types to ensure one gets the 4x4 capability only when it's essential, thus saving the extra effort of the vehicle. I am sure it must be helping out on the fuel efficiency numbers as well. With the Compass, a new beast of performance is here. I am keeping my fingers crossed and will be watching how the sales of the Compass take off.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,"I saw the Jeep Compass at a nearby dealership today. It is smaller than what it looks in the images. The Tucson, in comparison, looks wider. Sit inside and the quality of the materials used is good. The space is also decent and two six-feet tall guys can sit one behind the other. But it doesn't look as wide as you think it will be. From the driver's seat, it feels as if you're sitting in a vehicle of Creta's size. After sitting in the Compressed, sorry Compass, I felt that the starting price of around Rs 15 lakh is fair, and not very aggressive. Also, considering the reliability issues with the brand in most other markets, even if you are saving some money upfront, it'll be used up on the SUV only, and may not count as savings. There were a lot of people out there to check the Compass in the dealership and it looks like it will sell in good numbers. But I think I'll wait to see how Jeep fares in the after-sales department.

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"People say that the electronics won't work out in India but MG has proved almost everyone wrong. Speaking of electronics, the car is fully loaded with advanced technology and none of them feels like it's overdone. My second point is the mileage, Hector is an SUV but still offers great mileage of around 16kmpl. The dimensions of the car are humungous. In terms of comfort, the car can beat any of its rivals and is also prepared to compete with upper-class SUVs like Fortuner, Endeavour, etc. I recently went on a road trip in my hector and the ride quality was amazing, the suspensions were pretty soft providing a clean ride. Though the car is pretty huge, it is easily drivable in the city without any problem. I've heard it is also called the internet car due to the presence of a massive touch screen system with a pretty clear voice assistant. It manages to recognize the Indian accent as well.

Tata Harrier is fair and the interior is worst. The segment king Hyundai Creta is just like I20 wearing heels it is not a car Worth buying. I waited for mg was confused in hector and Creta but Hector was just better than Creta in terms of design, features, interior.

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"I drove MG Hector (Sharp) Petrol Hybrid for more than 1000kms. Both in city traffic (200km) and on national highway (800km). It gives superior comfort for drivers/passengers. HiTech features make you feel like you are in full control of the car. No complaints in this section. Overall I am very happy. After driving it on different roads in city & highways, I don't feel the acceleration is leaner enough in all gears. Overall I felt it is ""sluggish"" / ""underpowered."" The fuel efficiency is not up to the figures declared by MG India (i.e. 15.8 kmpl). I only got 9 to 10 kmpl in city & 11 to 13kmpl in Highways.

The safety features of this car are very good, 6 airbags, Abs, EBD, TC, Hill hold etc. The design of this car is awesome and the comfort is very good. The rear passenger gets a rear armrest, rear Ac vents and a good amount of space. The main attraction of this car is the internet Inside 10.4-inch huge touch screen. It's really awesome. The sound quality is also great. Pros:- 1. Value for money 2.

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"The length and wheelbase are the largest amongst its rivals, though the narrow girth and excessive rear overhang do throw proportions off a bit. The 17-inch wheels also look a size too small. Generous use of chrome means the Hector is big on bling and elements like the split LED DRLs and headlamps set up ensure the MG grabs attention. The MG's cabin is simply cavernous and there is plenty of space for five passengers and their luggage. Range-topping versions get a massive panoramic sunroof that only adds to the airy feel in the interior. There are lots of other goodies onboard and the features really are a draw in their own right. The much talked about a 10.4-inch touchscreen that comes armed with connectivity tech is the focal point on the dashboard. Material quality is largely good but you will find some less special bits in the interior as well. The MG Hector Diesel is 170 HP, 2.0-liter engine, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, packs enough grunt and impresses with its linear power delivery and refinement. A snappy clutch remains a pain point of the Fiat-sourced engine though. The MG Hector Petrol gets a 143 HP, 1.5-liter turbocharged unit with a 6-speed manual as standard and a 48 V mild-hybrid setup as an option. The petrol hybrid is easy-going but lacks oomph for quick overtakes. The dual-clutch transmission does add convenience to the package but it's not the slickest of gearboxes. The ride quality is fairly good at town speeds, but up the pace, and you'll get a fair bit of body movement on undulating surfaces. The MG doesn't feel as well tied down as rivals at triple-digit speeds either and the noticeable body roll also means it simply isn't a driver's car. The steering isn't the most fearsome but it is light at low speeds and makes it easy to maneuver the large SUV.",5,Brij Bhushan Katoch,20-Nov-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/it-is-a-very-cool-car-94123.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"I own a petrol hybrid MG Hector and the experience has been amazing to date. Have completed 2k kms. 1. The engine : sufficient power for this sized car. I initially thought the power to weight ratio would be evident when it comes to pulling the car, but I haven't experienced lack of power in most scenarios. The noise and vibrations are so low that sometime you wouldn't even know if the car is switched ON. 2. Driveability : light steering & clutch plus smooth gear transmission, it's an amazing combination to have especially if you drive a lot in the city. On the highway the steering doesn't feel very light, so you have sufficient control over the vehicle. Around the corners there definitely is the trademark SUV crossover bodyroll. If you are sitting in the rear seat, then you can be assured that you are sitting in the most comfortable space which you wouldn't get in any car. 3. Fuel efficiency: 6th gear and 80-120kms is the sweet spot for this car. Put it in this range and ull set records with the mileage. Mine clocks 19-21 km/L in this range. Within city under heavy traffic conditions I get 7-9km/L. 4. Infotainment system: a lot have complained on the sluggishness of the system, and even I felt the system to be slow. The latest update has fixed this issue. The system is smoother now. With a USB connected you can view photos and videos as well. 5. Space and overall comfort: the hector scores a 11/10 over here.. 10/ 10 with the sunroof closed and 11 with an open sunroof. Overall this is an awesome car in this segment and should be an obvious pick for anyone who is looking out to by am SUV crossover between 15 to 23Lakhs on-road price.",5,Anonymous,6-Oct-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/amazing-car-88851.htm

I love the front of the car but at the back, it looks like an Audi as it has been given an Audi like finish. The second row is very spacious and it feels very airy due to its panoramic sunroof and its large windows can never make a person claustrophobic. It gives a tough comparison to Ford Endeavour and Toyota Fortuner. I hope that by early 2020 MG Hector 7-seater will be released and also the BS6 complain will also be launched.

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"Regret the day I decided to purchase MG Hector. It took two weeks after delivery of the car to get the documentation in order. However, the worse nightmare was to follow: 1. On highway driving, the mileage of the MG Hector (Petrol) is 8.76 (tank full to tank full)! This is shocking. 2. Air-conditioning is very poor. At L1 (coolest) setting and at an ambient temperature of fewer than 35 degrees, it was uncomfortable inside the car. 3. The pick-up is very poor. Even on a small slope, and at low gear (2 or 3), the car struggles to move. 4. Many of the so-called ""high tech"" features do not work. On the plus side, the vehicle is spacious and four (not five) persons can sit comfortably. I am sorry that credible websites like you and others did not bring out these obvious deficiencies when you reviewed this vehicle.",1,Rajeev Thakore,12-Aug-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/poor-mileage-poor-performance-vehicle-78073.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"Hello, this is just a review after doing 4000 km on diesel top-end variant. I will not get into looks and interiors as so many people have written on it. I would just focus on my 4000 km travel experience. Did hill as well as national and state highway driving? Touched 170 km/h speed. Car is excellent to drive and braking at high-speed is fantastic. No vibration or sitting while breaking, just stops straight. On the bridge, joints do not jump or shake. Would rate it better than a Fortuner or Q5 which I have driven on some roads (Lucknow to Delhi). Hill driving did between Kanpur and shaktinagar. On hill, I find the car has less power especially when u change gears. The car has a perfect grip on hill turns. The car gave me an average fuel consumption of 18 between Kanpur and shaktinagar. Very comfortable seats just don't feel tired. Everything was perfect except for two issues. 1. headlights need improvement as on rainy night visibility gets bad. 2. Wiper blades need some improvement as it leaves some foggy impression on the glass for a second.",5,Sameer Bhargava,6-Aug-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/superb-car-mg-hector-76699.htm

MG driving experience (diesel), I noticed the engine sound is a bit lower than the compass and the harrier. It gives good power. wheel spin is controlled, but I noticed one issue that space (gap) between the clutch pedal and the dead pedal is low its bit discomfort for the driver. the suspension is supreme but doesn't know the condition at corners. Music system (infinity) is supreme, but the white cloth-like cover for the sunroof has no quality. The wheel size could be better. the instrument cluster is not up to the mark.

Display touch: Touch is not that much responding as expected. one can say that Touch is the same as in Chinese mobile. 3. cooling issue: Rear seat passenger is going to face this issue in Hot weather. Rear vent cooling is not as per the expectations. Due to the sunroof, rear seats have a much higher temperature. 4. The biggest issue which the one will face is the battery issue.

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"MG Hector is a huge hit in India. Booking numbers are over 15,000 units in about 15 days post launch. Waiting period in most cities has touched 7 months, and increasing. With production of Hector limited to just 2,000 units a month, it is going to be a long wait for most buyers. The good news is that deliveries have started, and are in full swing Just like the Hector, there is another SUV which is all set for India launch, that has managed to garner a similar kind of buzz; and that is the Kia Seltos. With all the details about Kia Seltos now available, it is time to take a look at both MG Hector and Kia Seltos specs on paper. MG Hector and Kia Seltos are both equipped with connected car technologies, come in with an array for first in segment features and brim over with driver and passenger conveniences and comforts. They are both well equipped in terms of safety and both receive powerful engine lineup. The MG Hector is officially launched in India whereas the Kia Seltos is slated for launch on 22nd August 2019. Despite their similarities, there are some vital differences which are detailed below; Exterior Design and Features ? MG Hector is offered in four trims ? Style, Super, Smart and Sharp and color schemes of Candy White, Aurora Silver, Glaze Red, Starry Black and Burgundy Red. It boasts of a tall stance and commanding road presence. It is fitted with a large front grille with extensive use of chrome in its makeup, all LED lamps at the front and rear and side indicators along with silver finished skid plates, 17? dual tone alloy wheels and squared wheel arches. The silver finished roof rails and large panoramic sunroof enhance its sporty appeal along with chrome elements at the rear and a chrome bar that is positioned above the license plate. Dimensions ? MG Hector boasts of larger dimensions as compared to the Kia Seltos even though both are compact SUVs. The Hector stands 4,655mm in length, 1,835mm in width and 1,760mm in height. It gets a wheelbase of 2,750mm. On the other hand, the Kia Seltos stands distinctively shorter in length at 4,315mm while width is at 1,800mm, height at 1,620mm and wheelbase at 2,610mm. These dimensions could mean that the cabin of the Seltos would be a bit cramped as compared to that seen on the Hector while boot space will also be more spacious in the Hector as compared to that of the Seltos. Interior Features, Safety and Technology ? Interiors of the MG Hector boast of a neat design. The seats are comfortable and well bolstered with contouring for better passenger comforts and done up in soft touch upholstery in contrasting leather. The 10.4? full HD touchscreen sees fewer buttons. There are piano black inserts seen on the central console with grey accents on the dashboard enhancing its premium appeal. Where safety is concerned, compliance to new safety norms bring in electronic stability program, hill assist, cruise control, powered seats and 360 degree camera, rear parking sensors, 6 airbags, ABS and EBD as standard. MG Hector is the first connected compact SUV to launch in India. It woos tech savvy buyers in India with its array of advanced in-car technologies for which the company has linked up with global tech partners such as like Microsoft, Adobe, SAP, Cisco, Nuance, Gaana, TomTom and Unlimit. This car also receives Internet Protocol version 6, making it 5G ready and the e-SIM is provided by Airtel and MG Motors offering internet connectivity for the complete warranty period. Kia Seltos also commands well designed interiors with comfortable seating, an 8 speaker sound system from Bose, a first in segment 10.25? touchscreen infotainment system and a 7? color TFT unit for the instrument console. There is a bounty of safety features offered on the Kia Seltos. These include ABS, EBD, ECS, 6 airbags, traction control, stability management, hill start assist, brake assist, front and rear parking cameras and a 360 degree camera for all round visibility. The occupant cell has been designed for maximum protection in the event of a crash with high steel and deformation zones to absorb impact. Kia calls its connected technology as UVO which can be accessed via a smartphone. It offers a total of 37 connectivity features with roadside assistance and SOS to alert a call center in the event of an emergency. Price ? MG Hector is priced between Rs.12.18 lakhs and Rs.16.88 lakhs. Kia has not yet disclosed pricing of the upcoming Seltos which could be offered in a much lower price bracket starting from as low as Rs.11 lakhs going up to Rs.16 lakhs for the top end variant.",4,We Punjabi Music,12-Jul-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/all-about-mg-hector-72013.htm

The Hector is certainly a head-turner and it drew quite an audience everywhere and every time we stopped for photos on the picturesque route from Coimbatore to Coonoor. The nose has lots of interesting detailing and follows the current trend where the headlight cluster is placed down at bumper level with the LED DRLs sitting above where the lights typically should be. The humongous grille, which you just can?t miss, feels a touch oversized, even on a car so big though. The blade-like DRLs further accentuate the size of the grille and look great when illuminated. There's a good dose of chrome, of course, used liberally around the grille, and C-shaped headlight housings. The prominent air intake in the lower bumper and massive skid plate look the part and give the Hector serious SUV credibility.",5,Annmay Kadve,2-Jul-19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/amazing-journey-ahead-69841.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"Highly anticipated Hector mow launched at a staggering price of 12.18 lakhs ex-showroom PAN India and it is super value for money and well suited for family kind of person. Hector has the biggest dimensions in its segment and really impresses on the space department. the boot is also the largest and ample for long picnics with the family. The engines are powerful, 2.0 diesel is very powerful and efficient and the 1.5-liter turbo petrol is also offered in DCT and 48v battery for efficiency and boost in power. The hector is very advanced in technology department as it comes with connected car technologies like geofencing and tomtom live maps and many more! The overall ride quality is awesome but it suffers on handling department because of massive dimensions and soft suspension but it doesn't matter a lot and not a deal breaker. On the reliabily front, the hector comes with a 5-year warranty and many schemes to attract customers. MG has also collaborated with Cardekho to improve customer satisfaction.

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"By looking at the specifications and features, MG Hector seems to be a strong contender in its segment. It excels in every department be it engine, features, design, space. It comes with many segment-first features like an internet-based vertically mounted 10.4 inches infotainment system, a full panoramic sunroof, connected car features, etc that make it more appealing to the Indian consumer. Apart from features, MG Hector is also very well equipped in terms of safety. Safety features like dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, ESP, traction control, all four disc brakes, hill hold assist, and ISOFIX child seat mounts are stand across the range. Only if MG can price the Hector aggressively, somewhere between 15-20 Lakh then I think it will be a value for money option for buyers in the segment. As MG is a new brand in the Indian automotive market, it will be interesting to see how MG handles the sale and service of its vehicles. To me, MG Hector seems to be a solid competitor to other vehicles in its segment. It seems to be a sensible choice for someone who is looking to buy a well built and feature-rich SUV under 20 Lakhs.

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,"When I hear that car is coming to India which will be the first Indian electric SUV, I am surprised about that. This car's look is not so crispy as much as Tata's harrier, but it damns electric beast. This car doesn't shine us, this car speaks to us. Every Indian should purchase all car from MG brands only even though they are Chinese owned, reason that MG is an electric car. At least Indian pollution will be reduced instead of Globalisation of car trading across the world. If Tesla comes to Indian Market it will take 250% more import charge as much as 85 lakh rupees for just 25 lakh rupees tesla in the US states. Hats off to China for doing something changes to Indian environment. The reason why I am supporting China. Indians don't have the hope to produce own electric car even they are electrical engineers and the other hand government don't provide fund for an electric vehicle startup project. They don't care about success. But MG does. It provides their SUV not sedan in just between 15 to 20 lakh. I hope I may be the first customer. Thinking you.
